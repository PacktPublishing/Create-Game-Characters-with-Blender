WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:04.080
Well let's see if we can work on the U-V mapping for the face.

00:04.080 --> 00:16.210
Now when we last left off I was kind of wondering what we could do about the face and the problem is

00:16.210 --> 00:22.380
is that we've got a pretty big difference between the back of the head and the front of the head in

00:22.380 --> 00:26.510
terms of the size of the U-V test pattern.

00:27.280 --> 00:33.730
So what I'd like to do is try and change the proportion a bit so we have more even squares from the

00:33.730 --> 00:36.920
front of the face to the back of the head.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.660
So let's see if we can do that.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.630
So here is our you've had head.

00:43.060 --> 00:50.680
I'm going to press the control up arrow to go to full screen here for this particular window and I'm

00:50.680 --> 00:59.020
going to choose U-V Island selection right down here and I can select this and hit the G key and move

00:59.020 --> 01:02.580
it around in the Arkie and rotate it.

01:02.710 --> 01:06.980
And I also think i'll scale it up a bit just so I can see it a little better.

01:07.920 --> 01:16.720
All right so how are we going to make this part of the face larger in proportion to the rest of the

01:16.720 --> 01:18.050
U-V Island.

01:18.060 --> 01:23.640
Well Blendr has some tools down here that we can use I'm going to click on the UVA's menu and it's got

01:23.640 --> 01:29.600
this pin feature and it's got live unwrap and these can be pretty useful.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.020
Let's try these.

01:31.050 --> 01:40.170
I'm going to first turn on live unwrap and now I'm going to come out here and in Virtex mode I'm going

01:40.170 --> 01:49.040
to click here or U-V selection mode I should say I'm going to select just these four corners here.

01:50.330 --> 01:54.610
You know what I should do is seal up this particular seam.

01:54.620 --> 01:57.220
I don't really need this seemed to be broken out.

01:57.380 --> 01:59.960
So let me go back and do that real quick.

01:59.960 --> 02:08.030
All we have to do is just select these edges and clear the clear the seams so I'm just going to select

02:08.030 --> 02:13.570
these edges and press control E and clear seam.

02:13.580 --> 02:21.020
Now I can come back and hover over this portion of the model press the L key that will only select this

02:21.020 --> 02:27.110
area and I'm going to unwrap this again I'll press you and unwrap and there we go.

02:27.110 --> 02:32.250
So it's just the head again without that seem broken off.

02:32.400 --> 02:40.010
Press Control arrow again to go to full screen and now I'm going to select these points again all the

02:40.010 --> 02:40.520
way around.

02:40.520 --> 02:47.780
So one here one here and one here just so I've got these four corners selected and then I'm just going

02:47.780 --> 02:49.330
to press the key.

02:49.580 --> 02:55.670
And if you can see what it's done it's added these little red markers to each of those points and those

02:55.670 --> 02:57.220
are our pins.

02:57.230 --> 03:00.960
Now with live unwrap on here I have it checked.

03:00.980 --> 03:09.600
I can select one of these points hit the key to move and you can see it kind of stretches it and scales

03:09.600 --> 03:15.400
it based on the position of those pinned vertices.

03:15.480 --> 03:23.790
So I'm going to try and just reduce the size of everything else but the face a bit like this just selecting

03:23.790 --> 03:33.140
these and moving them around a little bit like so fast control up there and go take a look at this and

03:33.140 --> 03:34.610
it's helped a little bit.

03:34.610 --> 03:37.490
These now are a little bit bigger in the back.

03:38.350 --> 03:41.600
These are still kind of too big in the front.

03:41.680 --> 03:49.420
So let's see if we can find another tool that will help us what we can use now is the proportional editing

03:49.420 --> 03:55.570
tool and I'm going to middle mouse button click and drag over here so I can move this bar and we can

03:55.570 --> 03:57.180
see it here.

03:57.190 --> 04:03.880
So what this can allow us to do is will basically change the proportion of the island here so I'm going

04:03.880 --> 04:09.750
to first of all press the C key and that gives me the circle select brush.

04:09.760 --> 04:15.770
And I'm just going to come in here and select I'm going to scroll the mouse wheel to make the brush

04:15.770 --> 04:22.460
a little bigger and then I'm going to select everything in here.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.210
Let me try this.

04:24.240 --> 04:32.460
Now going to come down here and turn on the proportional editing tool and let me once again press control

04:32.460 --> 04:36.540
up arrow to make this a little bit bigger so we can see it.

04:37.200 --> 04:43.740
And if I press the esky for the scale tool we can't see it yet I'm going to zoom out now and press the

04:43.980 --> 04:51.540
key here is the proportional editing brush and I'm going to zoom in with the scroll wheel or make it

04:51.660 --> 04:53.700
smaller with the scroll wheel.

04:53.700 --> 05:00.680
So now if I hit the key you can see I've got the boundaries of the proportional editing scale.

05:00.870 --> 05:05.070
And if I move the mouse it'll kind of scale it up like this.

05:05.070 --> 05:08.790
See how it's kind of scaling up the center of the brush.

05:08.790 --> 05:10.810
Bigger than the outside of it.

05:11.610 --> 05:18.650
So let me go back here control up arrow and let me watch this to see what I can do with this.

05:18.660 --> 05:28.880
See if we can do to press the s key and I'm going to expand that a bit maybe scroll in some Yeah see

05:28.880 --> 05:37.020
how it's kind of getting those squares to be a little bit smaller in proportion to the rest of the island.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.340
And we come around here and look.

05:39.510 --> 05:47.910
Now we're getting some stretching here and that's going to happen a bit let me try this again maybe

05:47.910 --> 05:50.360
something like this let's try this.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.020
That's not looking too bad.

05:52.020 --> 06:00.690
We've got the squares up front and the squares in the back about the same size and kind of like it to

06:00.690 --> 06:04.140
be a little bit bigger if I could.

06:04.180 --> 06:05.950
There we go something like that.

06:08.080 --> 06:08.740
OK.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.750
So that's pretty good.

06:09.750 --> 06:13.740
We've got some stretching as I said and you can see it here.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.890
So what can we do about that.

06:15.990 --> 06:23.790
Well let's press the control up here again and zoom in and what we can do about this is once again press

06:23.790 --> 06:33.240
the C key and I'm going to select these vertices are these Uvas in here where the stretching is happening.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.380
And let's see if we can do something about this.

06:36.410 --> 06:43.120
Now I'm going to if you look under the Uvas menu you can see that we've got this minimized stretch which

06:43.120 --> 06:45.080
is control the.

06:45.100 --> 06:51.530
So I'm going to press control the and then look how it's relaxed it quite a bit.

06:51.540 --> 06:59.070
And then I can scroll the mouse wheel and change how much it's being relaxed.

06:59.180 --> 07:03.830
Now if there we go see you can see it on the model there.

07:04.170 --> 07:09.080
And that's kind of stretched but that's not bad right there.

07:09.120 --> 07:16.290
So that's a couple of ways that we can read proportion are U.V. Islands to get a better lay out for

07:16.380 --> 07:18.450
something like the face.

07:18.450 --> 07:18.780
All right.

07:18.780 --> 07:25.680
Let's go back to the default view and let's think about these hands.

07:25.680 --> 07:32.820
So for this I'm going to press the L key to select this and the L key to it that and then press shift.

07:32.830 --> 07:39.120
H Well I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to try using a seam right down here or something to

07:39.300 --> 07:48.450
press the old key and click on this edge and I'll center that up and then press the C key and press

07:48.600 --> 07:59.370
the middle mouse button to de-select these edges right here and then oh Mark ISim control e and Marxian.

07:59.370 --> 08:02.960
Now let's go see how this is going to work for us.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.930
Back to the editor frame that up and press you and unwrap.

08:10.940 --> 08:11.630
All right.

08:11.870 --> 08:12.860
Yeah that's not too bad.

08:12.860 --> 08:17.940
So let's go ahead and do that with the rest of the fingers as well.

08:18.050 --> 08:21.160
I'll break them apart with these edges down here.

08:22.250 --> 08:29.250
I like this and I'll grab this edge right along here as well.

08:32.060 --> 08:39.360
Now that I've broken those apart with those seams I'll go ahead and select these edges here.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.430
This edge.

08:40.460 --> 08:51.750
This this this and then with that circle select tool that c key I will come in here and middle mouse

08:51.750 --> 08:54.750
button click and drag to de-select these

08:58.510 --> 09:07.090
like so control easy mark scheme and let's see what we can do with these you and unwrap.

09:07.450 --> 09:09.710
Yeah that looks pretty good.

09:09.730 --> 09:12.890
Let's go back to the default view.

09:13.630 --> 09:22.300
Press alt h to bring everything back and all go back to object mode and press shift see to center everything

09:22.300 --> 09:23.890
up.

09:23.890 --> 09:36.190
Now you may have noticed that I haven't done this glove this hand or this leg as well as the buckle

09:36.190 --> 09:42.130
here and that's because I'm going to mirror these over from one side to the other.

09:42.230 --> 09:47.810
So I'm actually going to wait and mirror these over at the very end and there you the islands will then

09:47.810 --> 09:51.000
be one on top of the other and therefore will.

09:51.020 --> 09:58.110
We should be able to get all the remaining islands a little bigger and therefore more resolution the

09:58.120 --> 09:59.210
U.V. map.

09:59.720 --> 10:06.530
So to do that let's go through and select all of these pieces and I'm just going to hit X and delete

10:06.680 --> 10:10.970
faces all of these.

10:11.140 --> 10:19.040
So now let's go back to the U-V editor and what we can do here is select everything and I'll select

10:19.340 --> 10:20.790
everything over here.

10:20.990 --> 10:24.560
And I notice I mean press control up arrow again.

10:24.790 --> 10:29.160
I still have some pins I need to clear those.

10:29.180 --> 10:34.680
So with everything is selected I can come down to this Uvas menu and you can see here that unpinned

10:34.700 --> 10:35.270
is Alt.

10:35.270 --> 10:40.030
P So I'll just press alt P to get rid of all the pens.

10:40.340 --> 10:47.960
And now what I want to do is I'm going to use this average Island scale control a and pack islands control

10:47.960 --> 10:53.090
P So I'll average the scale of all the U-V islands with control a.

10:53.390 --> 10:58.630
And then I'll pack them all into this zero to one space with control P.

10:58.730 --> 11:07.130
Now that's not bad but I think I would like the characters face to be a little bit bigger in relation

11:07.130 --> 11:11.940
to everything else because that's where they're going to be a main focus of the character.

11:12.140 --> 11:19.900
So I'm going to come over here to U-V Island select and just click on this U-V island.

11:20.210 --> 11:23.610
I'll come down here and turn off the proportional editing tool.

11:24.630 --> 11:31.830
And then I'll hit R and rotate it so we can see it here and I'll scale it up just a bit just so we get

11:31.830 --> 11:35.000
a little bit more resolution on that.

11:35.010 --> 11:42.060
Now what I'll do is all REPAK so I'll press a to select everything and this time I won't press control

11:42.090 --> 11:44.810
a because I don't want to read average everything.

11:44.820 --> 11:51.950
I just want to pack everything in with its current proportions so I press control P and there we go.

11:52.410 --> 12:00.750
Now if I press control up arrow to come back here you can see in this panel I've got my rotate checkbox

12:00.810 --> 12:08.160
I'm going to click this and that'll bring it back so that face U-V island is kind of upright.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.720
All right so that looks pretty good.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.860
So I'm in a press control up there again and take a look at it.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.290
And here we have it.

12:14.340 --> 12:17.070
Now what about the other pieces.

12:17.070 --> 12:24.270
Well all we need to do is duplicate them mirror them over and they're U-V islands will appear right

12:24.360 --> 12:26.320
underneath the current ones.

12:26.430 --> 12:29.000
So let's give that a try.

12:29.010 --> 12:33.930
I'm going to do this in the default view just so I can see it a little better.

12:33.930 --> 12:37.840
So what I mean by that is I'll take the leg here.

12:38.940 --> 12:47.110
Pressing the L key to select all of that or select that to we go.

12:47.510 --> 12:54.860
So now I want to duplicate this with shift D and I'll press enter and then I want to split it out into

12:54.860 --> 13:02.450
its own object so I'll press the P key which will bring up the separate menu and I'll click selection.

13:02.450 --> 13:04.490
Now here it is here.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.160
There it is I mean just press the key and you can see it there.

13:08.090 --> 13:15.850
Now I'll just go to add a modifier and mirror and then I'll click apply.

13:16.020 --> 13:23.550
And what that did is it duplicated it married it over with the U-V map and placed it right underneath

13:23.550 --> 13:25.610
the current U-V Island.

13:25.650 --> 13:30.580
So let's do that again let's try this glove here.

13:30.960 --> 13:42.270
I'm going to hit the L key to select that press shift d enter press P selection here it is here I'll

13:42.500 --> 13:46.970
add a mirror modifier and then apply it there.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.520
All right how about the hand.

13:48.980 --> 13:50.460
Let's tap into here.

13:50.480 --> 13:55.840
I'll press the L key for this shift D.

13:56.310 --> 14:02.030
Press the enter key p separate by selection.

14:02.030 --> 14:08.360
Here it is mere modifier and apply.

14:08.470 --> 14:15.840
And then lastly if we just select this belt buckle I can select that and duplicate it.

14:16.390 --> 14:18.680
Chris P and separate it out.

14:19.700 --> 14:24.940
And there it is now the pivot point is down here.

14:24.950 --> 14:30.760
I'm going to move that origin to the geometry zoom in.

14:30.760 --> 14:35.110
And now I can just move it up and put it into place.

14:35.110 --> 14:42.980
So now if we go back to the U-V editor once we combine all of these objects together because if I select

14:43.010 --> 14:49.220
this you can see that the pieces that we duplicated and mirrored still aren't a part of this so we need

14:49.220 --> 14:51.790
to hit the A key to select everything.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.620
Press Control J.

14:53.990 --> 14:57.500
To join all the pieces into one object.

14:57.500 --> 15:05.210
Now if I hit the tab key and the A key you can see that they're all in here.

15:05.350 --> 15:07.930
They're just one underneath the other.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.300
So let's see if we can find one.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.330
There it is.

15:11.410 --> 15:16.180
So you can see the duplicate of that piece is right there underneath it.

15:16.180 --> 15:22.220
And that's just one way to help maximize the resolution within the U-V map.

15:22.510 --> 15:23.050
All right.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.850
Well I think we did it.

15:24.850 --> 15:33.780
I think we've U-V mapped our character and in the next series of videos we'll begin working on breaking

15:33.790 --> 15:42.010
out our normal map and our ambient occlusion map so that we can capture our high resolution sculped

15:42.010 --> 15:45.070
details onto the low polygon object.
