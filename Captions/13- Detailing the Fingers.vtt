WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:03.000
Work a little bit more on the hands.

00:03.300 --> 00:07.520
We did quite a bit and the last video.

00:07.530 --> 00:14.070
But there's still a little undefined at this point in time I'd like to give a little more detail to

00:14.070 --> 00:14.970
them.

00:14.970 --> 00:22.170
So I'm going to press Allt F to center up the tumble right around the knuckles here.

00:22.620 --> 00:29.770
And also I'll go ahead and hide the rest of the character since we don't need all of that.

00:29.820 --> 00:36.000
While we're working on the hands to do that I'll need to go over to sculpt mode first.

00:36.120 --> 00:44.280
And we go now I should be able to press the H key and click and drag and hide those away.

00:44.340 --> 00:51.870
I think I'll use the sculpt draw brush while I'm here to just define find the knuckles a little better

00:51.870 --> 00:53.140
right here.

00:57.450 --> 00:58.110
So

01:03.170 --> 01:09.290
and then maybe smooth goes back just a hair I go.

01:09.420 --> 01:14.240
I'll also want a little more definition to the knuckles on the top.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.890
But first I think I'm going to define the pads on the other side of the fingers.

01:20.340 --> 01:23.340
So let's come over here to this side.

01:23.990 --> 01:30.460
Let's give a little more definition to the fleshy part at the base of each of the fingers.

01:30.710 --> 01:41.530
And to do that I'll use once again the mask tool and maybe I'll just mask this area like this

01:44.000 --> 01:53.370
something like this just to mask this out so we don't accidentally sculped on this and then we can come

01:53.370 --> 01:57.910
back to something like the inflate brush maybe.

01:58.320 --> 02:05.250
Let's try this and maybe we could inflate those up a little bit along that edge and that will beef that

02:05.250 --> 02:09.090
up and give us maybe a nice crease there.

02:09.550 --> 02:13.470
May be a bit too much but let's try that.

02:13.470 --> 02:20.870
So yeah hopefully that will give us a little crease there at the edge of the fingers.

02:20.910 --> 02:28.620
Now we can try that again with the pads up here so if I reduce the brush size here and go back to the

02:29.220 --> 02:33.140
mask I'll clear it with him.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.050
Let's see.

02:34.200 --> 02:42.920
Let's just test on one of these for a second a test here on this part of the finger.

02:42.990 --> 02:47.290
What I want to do is just try and define this pad right here.

02:47.910 --> 02:53.760
So I'll take this and press control I need to invert the selection and then once again I'll come back

02:53.760 --> 03:00.050
to the inflate brush and just lightly inflate that up.

03:00.090 --> 03:03.820
So we've got a little bit of a pad to the finger there.

03:09.360 --> 03:15.940
And I can also press control eye and then work on these here as well so now I can work on this pad while

03:15.940 --> 03:18.340
that's masked out.

03:22.300 --> 03:29.750
And this one down here as well let's take a look at that with I'll press him and clear that and you

03:29.750 --> 03:36.020
can see we're getting a little bit more of the creases in the fingers.

03:36.020 --> 03:45.430
And it's another example I think of the concept of pulling out rather than cutting it.

03:45.440 --> 03:53.720
I think it's easier when you're modeling when you're extruding things when you're sculpting things.

03:53.720 --> 04:01.760
And I mentioned this some videos ago but when you've got an object where you have things cut in like

04:01.760 --> 04:09.320
these creases on the fingers try not to think about how can I cut in but try and think about how can

04:09.320 --> 04:18.770
I pull out how can I extrude out or sculpt out to get those creases to get that indentation or cut in

04:18.770 --> 04:20.490
or whatever it is you're doing.

04:22.110 --> 04:25.890
So let's work on the other fingers here.

04:26.820 --> 04:30.990
So I'm just going to try and do them all at the same time.

04:31.190 --> 04:37.500
I feel like this before I begin though I feel like this finger is a little too long.

04:37.710 --> 04:44.090
Let's try and use the grab brush on this and I'll come around here and let's just move this down here.

04:44.090 --> 04:46.320
Here we go.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.900
All right.

04:48.630 --> 04:52.290
So let's work on the pads of these other fingers as well.

04:52.310 --> 04:59.990
Go back to the mask tool and let's just mascon all of these.

05:00.120 --> 05:07.290
So if this one is here I'll probably want the mask of this one to be up here and then down here and

05:07.320 --> 05:10.200
down here so they kind of curve like this.

05:10.290 --> 05:14.540
And this one may be here here and here.

05:14.550 --> 05:16.110
Let's try that.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.970
I'm just trying to get a sense of where these should go.

05:21.590 --> 05:21.890
All right.

05:21.890 --> 05:30.140
Let's try this so I'll press control on and then go back to the inflate brush and try and beef these

05:30.140 --> 05:31.320
up just a bit.

05:35.790 --> 05:39.130
And let's work on this one now.

05:39.690 --> 05:44.870
I'm trying to get a nice rounded boulders to this.

05:45.690 --> 05:50.460
So I'm having to smooth some back periodically here.

05:52.130 --> 05:56.300
All right so this one here I'll start bringing this one up.

06:05.230 --> 06:05.700
All right.

06:05.710 --> 06:08.390
And then I'll work on this pinky here.

06:08.400 --> 06:13.610
Same thing just going to use the inflate brush to bulge this out a bit.

06:13.840 --> 06:21.100
And I'm also trying to make sure I get some bulge around the edges too so that we get those creases

06:21.100 --> 06:23.270
when we do the other parts of the fingers.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.840
All right so we have those.

06:27.940 --> 06:33.880
And of course what we need to do is press control eye and invert the mask and then let's come in and

06:33.880 --> 06:37.760
do the same thing for the rest of the fingers here.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.030
Now I could come back and put a mask on this area down here.

06:48.210 --> 06:53.370
Just so I don't accidentally ruin what I've done already down here.

06:53.370 --> 06:58.130
I'm going to try and be careful we'll see if I can do it without masking that again.

06:58.140 --> 06:59.830
But that's certainly a possibility.

06:59.850 --> 07:03.590
We could do that.

07:03.940 --> 07:11.250
And this really is one of those places where a pen and tablet is just absolutely necessary.

07:11.470 --> 07:17.300
There are lots of options for buying tablets you can get them use you can usually get them for under

07:17.320 --> 07:18.570
$100.

07:18.970 --> 07:24.420
One place or another whether it be on eBay or used off of amazon.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.720
But it really is very useful.

07:28.150 --> 07:28.640
All right.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.380
Press alt em and there we go.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.890
Now we've got the pads of the fingers.

07:33.940 --> 07:40.720
Sure we're going to need to do a little bit of smoothing and cleaning up but it's really a pretty effective

07:40.720 --> 07:45.080
way of creating those indentations in the fingers.

07:45.100 --> 07:50.010
Once again try not to think about cutting in so much as pulling out.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.210
Now one more thing I wanted to mention here.

07:53.410 --> 07:58.500
We've been modeling so far in an smoothed mode.

07:58.500 --> 08:05.590
Now as we increase the subdivisions of course it smooths it a little more and more but if we go over

08:05.590 --> 08:15.160
to object mode and go to the Tools tab and under shading if we click on smooth that'll smooth up the

08:15.670 --> 08:17.980
model quite a bit.

08:18.040 --> 08:26.770
So if you want to begin working in this more smooth mode as we work on more of the details you can do

08:26.770 --> 08:27.760
that as well.

08:27.820 --> 08:35.500
And then if you click flat that'll go back to the more faceted view of the polygons.

08:35.590 --> 08:38.160
So on that I go ahead and turn that on.
