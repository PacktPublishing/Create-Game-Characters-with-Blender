00:00.610 --> 00:03.090
Well today I'd like to work on these straps here.

00:03.090 --> 00:07.970
The straps going over the torso around the side.

00:08.140 --> 00:10.640
Maybe even the belt here.

00:10.810 --> 00:16.860
And what I'd like to do is use Blender's read typology tools to do this.

00:17.020 --> 00:26.370
We can use the B surfaces plug in and we can also use the snapping tools to do this as well.

00:26.380 --> 00:33.490
Now I'm going to be going over all of these tools again once we get to read apologizing the character

00:33.490 --> 00:37.860
as a whole wants the sculpting and modeling is all done.

00:38.380 --> 00:45.690
But I thought I'd kind of do a little preview here and frankly refresh my memory on the tools it's been

00:45.690 --> 00:47.510
a while since I've used them.

00:47.650 --> 00:55.110
So let's take a look at how we might create this strap over the character's shoulder here.

00:55.270 --> 01:03.280
We could of course take a polygon and extrude it around or try and make a cylinder and rotate it and

01:03.430 --> 01:06.490
adjust it until we get it to fit.

01:06.610 --> 01:14.180
But I think the B surfaces plug in is a lot easier to work with for something like this.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.290
So when I say that these services plug in what do I mean.

01:17.290 --> 01:26.350
Well let's if we go to file and user preferences and if we come over here to add ons the BE services

01:26.350 --> 01:31.790
plug in should be part of the blender install now.

01:32.080 --> 01:40.760
So if I type in the surf in the search field here you can see it brings up the services GPL EDITION.

01:40.870 --> 01:42.900
This is the plug in I'm talking about.

01:42.910 --> 01:50.140
And if you don't have it checked all ready all you need to do is put a checkmark here and then click

01:50.140 --> 01:58.530
save user settings and it's going to tell you here that it's going to be found in the view 3D edit mode.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.910
And on the tool shelf.

02:01.090 --> 02:10.570
So what that tells us is that in this 3-D view on the tool shelf over here this will be available in

02:10.690 --> 02:18.530
edit mode Well we don't really want it if we go into edit mode here we collapse our character.

02:18.720 --> 02:22.740
Granted I can now see the beast services plug in here.

02:23.070 --> 02:28.170
So we don't want to do it like this we don't want to have the character in edit mode.

02:28.170 --> 02:35.760
What we need is a piece of Blant geometry a piece of empty geometry to begin working with.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.610
So to do that I'm just going to go to the Create tab and create a cube.

02:40.350 --> 02:47.880
And what I'm going to do is call this cube I'll just call this for now I'll call it Toppo because we're

02:48.210 --> 02:51.140
we're using the real topology tools.

02:51.360 --> 02:59.580
But then what I'll do is come over to the cube selected press the tab key to go into Edit Mode make

02:59.580 --> 03:05.050
sure that everything is selected here by pressing a key.

03:05.160 --> 03:11.660
And then I'm just going to press X for delete and delete all vertices.

03:11.960 --> 03:16.820
And now it's still there as an object but it's completely empty.

03:16.820 --> 03:19.450
There is nothing there anymore.

03:19.640 --> 03:19.930
Right.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.630
So it's just an empty object.

03:22.640 --> 03:28.060
So now what we can do is turn on our grease pencil tools.

03:28.070 --> 03:35.030
I'm going to press the end key to open up the properties panel here and on and zoom into my character

03:35.030 --> 03:35.650
here.

03:36.860 --> 03:42.060
And I'll come over to my grease pencil tab right over here.

03:42.080 --> 03:49.400
So now I've got this grease pencil area over here and I've got this grease pencil there over here and

03:49.400 --> 03:52.820
they somewhat overlap but they're also a little different.

03:52.820 --> 04:00.260
So this honestly can be a bit confusing so what I want to be able to do is draw on the character with

04:00.260 --> 04:09.350
my grease pencil and have the be services create geometry create polygons based on my grease pencil

04:09.440 --> 04:11.370
lines.

04:11.450 --> 04:20.030
So with the grease pencil I want to be able to draw on the object I want to be able to draw continuously

04:20.030 --> 04:21.680
on the object.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.910
So enable that.

04:25.050 --> 04:28.640
I want to be able to draw so I'm going to enable draw.

04:29.550 --> 04:37.420
And what that does it creates a new Greece pencil data block and it creates a new Greece.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.760
Pencil layer slot here.

04:39.900 --> 04:45.630
But now that I have that I've been I've chosen object I and drawn the object I want to continuously

04:45.630 --> 04:49.470
draw on the object and I want to draw it on the surface of the object.

04:49.470 --> 04:56.550
So I click this right here and when I click surface it turned off my draw some and I have to click draw

04:56.550 --> 04:57.210
again.

04:57.210 --> 04:59.430
So I'll do that.

04:59.430 --> 05:03.070
Now I've got objects selected surface selected.

05:03.150 --> 05:08.320
I've got a new Greece pencil data block and a grease pencil layer.

05:08.790 --> 05:15.720
I should be able to now while my read Toppo is in edit mode.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.200
Begin drawing on my character here.

05:18.210 --> 05:24.300
So I'm going to come over here on the top and I'm going to draw a line right here.

05:25.860 --> 05:35.060
And right up here and draw kind of a crosshatch here over his shoulder.

05:36.130 --> 05:47.290
Like so now if I tumble around you can see that grease pencil was actually conformed to the model itself.

05:47.550 --> 05:51.510
Now I don't want to see through the character to the grease pencil.

05:51.510 --> 05:55.800
I can always just turn off the x ray here like that.

05:55.890 --> 05:57.960
Now it went ahead and applied it.

05:57.980 --> 06:02.190
I'm out of draw mode now because I clicked over here.

06:02.190 --> 06:09.510
I could have also pressed the enter key but now that I've done that I can come over to the Tools panel

06:10.020 --> 06:19.470
right here scroll down to my be services area and as I said with my read Toppo invisible object still

06:19.470 --> 06:20.300
in edit mode.

06:20.310 --> 06:29.340
If I click add surface it creates geometry based on the grease pencil lines that I drew Mamluks kind

06:29.340 --> 06:30.700
of hard to see.

06:30.720 --> 06:37.160
So what I can do is come over here to the object panel of the properties window here let me scroll this

06:37.170 --> 06:40.700
down here and choose x ray.

06:41.220 --> 06:45.260
And now I can see my geometry.

06:45.260 --> 06:49.460
It looks to me like the normals are flipped.

06:49.460 --> 06:53.900
Here you can see how this is kind of a darker gray than these.

06:53.900 --> 06:58.110
This polygon should be flipped around so they're all gray.

06:58.430 --> 07:05.070
I'm just going to select them all with a key and then press control in to recalculate the normals.

07:05.240 --> 07:11.120
And now I should have them all gray so I'll hit the A key and you can see they're all gray now.

07:11.120 --> 07:17.090
All right so now that I've gotten that piece drawn out what I want to do is extend this on down to where

07:17.720 --> 07:19.230
the belt is right down here.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.010
So I've created this piece.

07:21.010 --> 07:23.750
I want to go ahead and create this all the way down here.

07:24.050 --> 07:27.400
So what I can do is go back to the grease pencil.

07:27.410 --> 07:34.510
I'll come over here to the grease pencil tab I will click on draw once again.

07:34.530 --> 07:38.040
Let me get my character in place here.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.420
Now click on draw once again.

07:42.020 --> 07:53.090
And now I'm just going to draw lines like this down the character toward the waste kind of in an angle

07:53.090 --> 07:57.560
here like this on down here

08:01.960 --> 08:03.080
say like

08:07.680 --> 08:10.190
this.

08:10.250 --> 08:10.610
All right.

08:10.610 --> 08:14.990
So what I want to do is extend this edge on down through here.

08:15.570 --> 08:25.600
So now that I've drawn those I'll hit enter again and I'll go to edge mode and select this edge of my

08:25.600 --> 08:37.370
object and back in the tools tab I will come over here back to the B services area and click add surface

08:37.370 --> 08:39.380
and watch what happens.

08:39.380 --> 08:42.950
It extends that on down through those edges.

08:42.950 --> 08:44.800
Now that's too many edges.

08:44.990 --> 08:52.250
So I can come over here to this tool setting this be services settings panel and reduce the number of

08:52.250 --> 08:53.980
polygons here down to 1.

08:53.980 --> 08:58.130
So I'm just getting one polygon for each stroke.

08:58.260 --> 08:58.630
Right.

08:58.640 --> 09:02.350
And you can see how it's conforming to the character here.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.590
Let's do that again on the back now.

09:05.010 --> 09:10.370
So I'm come around here and I think I'm a turn off x ray for now because I don't want to see through

09:10.370 --> 09:12.630
it so I'll just uncheck this here.

09:13.810 --> 09:18.230
So now I'm going to go back to my grease pencil tab

09:21.080 --> 09:23.100
go here like this

09:26.830 --> 09:36.030
and click on draw and then draw new lines bringing it down like this down the back

09:43.250 --> 09:44.040
down here.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.610
I could see I go down to here.

09:47.030 --> 09:48.250
OK.

09:48.260 --> 09:50.360
So once again I'll press enter.

09:51.460 --> 09:55.660
Go into edge mode select this edge

09:58.580 --> 10:01.580
then I'll go back to my tools tab.

10:01.770 --> 10:07.600
Scroll down to be services and click add surface and there we go.

10:07.600 --> 10:16.180
Once again it's got too many edges so I'll reduce the follow setting here down to 1 and let's turn on

10:16.210 --> 10:18.470
x ray and take a look at it.

10:18.520 --> 10:25.250
So there it is so I can go through the same process for this side piece over here.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.320
Not exactly sure how that's going to work.

10:27.330 --> 10:36.720
I could maybe would say I come off of this edge right and go down and around and come back up to this

10:36.720 --> 10:37.620
edge.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.170
Let's give that a try.

10:39.360 --> 10:44.670
So back to grease pencil I'll turn off x ray here for a moment.

10:46.090 --> 10:52.660
And I'm going to want to come off of this edge here so I could draw and I want to come off this edge

10:52.660 --> 10:57.090
so I'll draw this and this

11:01.430 --> 11:09.510
and just try and bring it around as best I can so that it comes around and connects maybe with this

11:09.510 --> 11:10.990
one.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.080
All right so I'll press enter.

11:14.730 --> 11:23.730
Select this edge go to my services area and click add surface.

11:23.890 --> 11:32.230
Now that I've got to this point over here I could select these four points and hit the F key and it'll

11:32.260 --> 11:35.850
fill that face.

11:35.860 --> 11:41.530
So now when we come back to x ray and there we have the beginnings of our belt.
