00:00.770 --> 00:03.860
Well let's get these arms moving back and forth.

00:04.320 --> 00:08.160
Generally speaking the arms are going to be doing the opposite of what the legs are.

00:08.160 --> 00:14.860
So if the left leg is forward then the left arm is going to be back.

00:14.880 --> 00:20.550
So let's begin with our contact poses here at frames 1 and 7.

00:20.550 --> 00:24.550
And let's place our arms where we think they should be.

00:24.660 --> 00:34.050
The thing about inverse kinematics or I.K. arms is that we're going to have to be mindful of making

00:34.050 --> 00:40.220
sure that our arms and hands are giving us nice arcs or curves.

00:40.520 --> 00:48.990
They can have a tendency to look like a train piston going back and forth like this rather than giving

00:48.990 --> 00:50.910
us nice arcs.

00:50.940 --> 00:53.660
So we need to be mindful of that.

00:54.060 --> 00:54.360
All right.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.820
So here is our first contact position.

00:58.170 --> 01:07.180
Let me go to the side view here the orthographic view and sense our left leg is forward like this here.

01:07.260 --> 01:21.200
Let's make sure that our left arm is back and I need to move that in a bit and bring that down some.

01:21.270 --> 01:25.380
So he's kind of maybe going to swing like that.

01:25.380 --> 01:29.530
Let's bring that hammer down a bit.

01:29.530 --> 01:38.260
All right so now let's take this arm the right arm and move that forward a bit.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.380
I'll bring it in.

01:41.060 --> 01:47.480
Rotate that up a bit so the hand is more in line with the shield for now.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.900
That looks painful.

01:49.790 --> 01:54.430
Now I think I will go ahead and use this elbow control because that will help me move the shield to

01:54.430 --> 01:55.810
where I want it to be.

01:56.940 --> 01:59.140
Kind of like that.

01:59.170 --> 02:06.670
Go ahead and move the elbow control over just a bit to line that elbow up.

02:06.670 --> 02:13.270
Maybe I want to swing that hammer out just a bit so it doesn't hit him as it passes.

02:13.270 --> 02:20.260
So now that we've got our hands or our arms in place for our first contact position let's go ahead and

02:20.260 --> 02:22.110
select these hands.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.290
And also the elbow controls.

02:24.290 --> 02:28.660
I dealt with those two created key frames for those.

02:28.660 --> 02:36.130
And let's now come over here to the dope sheet and find those key frames so here we go we've got them

02:36.130 --> 02:37.110
here.

02:37.210 --> 02:42.820
The elbow targets down here and we've got to hand I.K. up here.

02:42.850 --> 02:51.140
So I want to go ahead and select these key frames those two there and these two here.

02:51.480 --> 02:57.040
Now for testing purposes I've reduced my frame range to 12.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.150
Let me get that back up to 13 here.

03:00.120 --> 03:00.570
There we go.

03:00.570 --> 03:03.470
So that includes that 13th key frame here.

03:03.630 --> 03:10.500
And what I'll do is just duplicate these and move them over to frame 13 saw press shift D and then just

03:10.500 --> 03:15.540
move the mouse all the way over to frame 13 and click.

03:15.540 --> 03:25.160
And now we should have those arms in place in the same way on both 13 and 1 OK.

03:25.200 --> 03:25.940
Good.

03:25.950 --> 03:33.470
So now we need to do the same thing on frame 7 except just the opposite of frame 1.

03:33.600 --> 03:39.500
So let's see if our copy and paste mirror will work for these as well.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.620
We were able to use it on the legs.

03:41.610 --> 03:44.230
Let's see if we can use it on the arms too.

03:44.260 --> 03:48.270
I'm going to scroll over here and find these buttons right here.

03:48.270 --> 03:53.520
So with these selected Now I've got the hands and the elbows at frame 1.

03:53.580 --> 04:02.480
I'm going to go ahead and copy this and then I'm going to move up to frame 7 and let's paste here right

04:02.480 --> 04:04.130
here and see what happens.

04:06.150 --> 04:08.610
Yeah that's not too bad.

04:08.640 --> 04:13.060
Now the hammer is in a bit of an awkward position but that's OK.

04:13.110 --> 04:15.310
Let's just go out and play this and see how it looks

04:18.810 --> 04:21.690
oh boy there he goes.

04:21.750 --> 04:26.750
So that's not too bad actually it looks like he's pounding himself in the head with the hammer but that's

04:26.780 --> 04:27.570
OK.

04:27.740 --> 04:29.320
We can fix that.

04:29.450 --> 04:29.950
Right.

04:29.960 --> 04:41.870
So what we've got is frame one here and then frame seven there and back to frame 13 here.

04:41.990 --> 04:45.520
So we've got some strangeness happening all through here.

04:45.830 --> 04:50.270
And that's because we've got all these extra key frames in here.

04:50.690 --> 04:57.110
Well we can do is really get rid of just about all of these for the hands and the elbows.

04:57.110 --> 05:04.610
I think what I'll do is just come through in the dope sheet and just get rid of these and they're just

05:04.700 --> 05:08.030
going to be fighting against us as we go.

05:08.390 --> 05:14.070
So here's these key frames on frame five.

05:14.330 --> 05:15.850
These are for the hand.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.690
I think we can just hit X and delete keyframes.

05:19.700 --> 05:23.520
Let's come over here to frame 8.

05:23.960 --> 05:34.010
Here's the hands and elbows down here and it looks like we can go all the way to frame 13 because here's

05:34.100 --> 05:35.840
the keyframes we just pasted.

05:35.840 --> 05:43.780
So I think what I'll do is just hit the Beaky and border select all of these and then the B key and

05:43.780 --> 05:46.080
border select all of these here.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.110
And I don't need those.

05:47.110 --> 05:50.480
So I'll just hit X and delete.

05:50.530 --> 05:54.730
So now we have just hopefully what we need.

05:55.580 --> 06:00.620
The contact positions at 1 7 and 13.

06:00.770 --> 06:06.280
Now notice what I mean about that kind of piston movement here.

06:06.290 --> 06:14.220
Let me go back to the side view as it goes from frame to frame 7.

06:14.240 --> 06:21.830
Notice that the I.K. handles just go in and exact straight line and that's going to be a problem we

06:21.830 --> 06:27.400
need to ensure that there's the nice curves there.

06:27.830 --> 06:32.960
Let's go back to frame for here and let's think about where the arms need to be here.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.980
We're coming from this position right here.

06:36.980 --> 06:44.700
And the hands need to Looks like they need to come down a bit and pass each other the way the legs do.

06:45.050 --> 06:47.990
So the left leg still in front here.

06:47.990 --> 06:52.490
This is the front leg but it's past and moving toward the back.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.400
We now want the left hand.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.980
Let me move back over here and turn off the gizmo real quick.

06:59.420 --> 07:09.890
We want this left hand to be passing probably right around in here and it will want the right hand over

07:09.890 --> 07:10.830
here.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.470
Probably be passing.

07:14.650 --> 07:19.310
I don't know down in here as well like that.

07:19.310 --> 07:22.420
Let's come around to the front and see how they look.

07:22.430 --> 07:23.810
That's not too bad.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.350
So let's go with that.

07:27.370 --> 07:30.300
Let's say that's what we want there.

07:30.370 --> 07:34.020
So we really want the opposite of this at frame 10 right.

07:34.060 --> 07:43.630
So if we copy this and scroll back over copy these two hand I.K. handles at frame for and then move

07:43.630 --> 07:50.750
over to frame 10 pace the opposite see how that works.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.840
All right so many hit play and see how we're doing.

07:54.450 --> 07:57.330
And there he goes look not too bad.

07:58.850 --> 08:02.310
All right so let's take a look at a couple of other key frames here.

08:02.330 --> 08:07.730
How about let's take a look at frame two here.

08:07.730 --> 08:09.080
These are still too high.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.210
These should probably come down just a bit.

08:11.660 --> 08:19.830
So I'm just going to take these and move them down just a hair like this maybe back a bit and move this

08:19.830 --> 08:23.550
down just a bit as well doesn't need to be quite that high.

08:23.550 --> 08:28.650
I'm going to deal with the hand rotation on the shield here in just a bit but I'm going to move that

08:28.650 --> 08:30.510
down some like that.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.920
And once again let's try and paste this at frame 8.

08:35.100 --> 08:41.310
So I'll select these copy moved frame 8 paste.

08:41.860 --> 08:44.010
OK so that moves those down just a bit.

08:44.010 --> 08:44.860
That's good.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.360
Let's see how we did yeah.

08:48.380 --> 08:54.010
So we've got frame 1 and 2 3 4.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.900
Looks like we could do something on three I think.

08:57.010 --> 09:00.600
These could be quite a bit farther down.

09:00.680 --> 09:05.190
I'll just move them kind of straight just move them kind of straight down like this.

09:05.210 --> 09:08.880
It kind of passes the body a little bit lower.

09:12.060 --> 09:14.640
Maybe something like that.

09:14.810 --> 09:23.720
And once again we can copy the cell copy these at frame three moved frame nine paste.

09:23.720 --> 09:25.740
Let's take a look at frame five.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.050
That's actually not too bad.

09:28.160 --> 09:32.910
I don't mind that have a frame 6 yeah.

09:33.230 --> 09:34.520
I'm OK with that.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.520
Let's take a look at these over here.

09:36.650 --> 09:40.610
Frame 11 and frame 12.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.790
Yeah I can live with that.

09:43.070 --> 09:44.280
Let's test it out.

09:45.230 --> 09:46.110
There he goes.

09:47.050 --> 09:47.970
Look at him go.

09:50.660 --> 09:51.990
All right.

09:52.210 --> 09:58.450
So now we've got a basic run cycle even though that's looking pretty good there's still some work to

09:58.450 --> 10:03.510
be done with the rotation of the hand and the placement of the elbows.

10:03.610 --> 10:09.700
And in addition I'd like to go back and take a look at some of these curves if we go back and take a

10:09.700 --> 10:12.540
look at I don't know let's take a look at one of these feet.

10:12.660 --> 10:15.260
How about the left foot here.

10:15.490 --> 10:25.790
And if we look at the curves for the left foot we can see that they're not beautiful in that.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.620
Take a look at this curve right here

10:30.530 --> 10:32.700
this X rotation right here.

10:33.110 --> 10:38.500
If we look at this we can see there these blips in the curves like one right here.

10:39.080 --> 10:47.000
And this is going to be a place where if you look at the foot right here see how it's kind of glitching

10:47.000 --> 10:54.460
out a little bit right between these keyframes right there and right there how it kind of flips back.

10:54.500 --> 11:02.300
We want to go in and work on those because those can really affect how we perceive the animation There's

11:02.300 --> 11:04.890
one over here to take a look at this one.

11:05.330 --> 11:09.150
So there's one there there's one here.

11:09.270 --> 11:17.630
Anywhere you see these sharp breaks these sharp reversal of direction on a curve.

11:17.660 --> 11:24.020
We really want these to be nice smooth arcs nice smooth curves if at all if at all possible.

11:24.020 --> 11:30.020
So what I'd like to do in the next video is to go through and begin to kind of clean these up and see

11:30.020 --> 11:35.190
if we can make the animation a little bit smoother and a little more pleasing.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.960
So we'll work on that in the next video.
