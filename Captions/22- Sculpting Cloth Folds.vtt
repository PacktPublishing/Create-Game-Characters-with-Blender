WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:05.200
Well I've got the glove fairly well set up here.

00:05.620 --> 00:11.440
I think what I'd like to do now is to work on this toga I've brought in an image here just an image

00:11.440 --> 00:19.910
I found on the Internet of just cloth wrinkles kind of hanging down from a circular structure here.

00:19.910 --> 00:26.530
I don't exactly know what this is of but I think it could be helpful here just to get these kinds of

00:26.530 --> 00:28.650
wrinkles.

00:28.690 --> 00:36.130
Here's the image from my reference drawing then I'm just going to begin working on maybe this front

00:36.130 --> 00:37.440
piece here.

00:37.480 --> 00:47.420
Now I've got the character on Layer 1 right here and I've got the clothes and accessories here on Layer

00:47.420 --> 00:48.110
2.

00:48.280 --> 00:52.210
So I'll just work with layer 2 for now I think.

00:52.210 --> 01:00.700
In addition I could also select this and isolated with shift H.

01:00.830 --> 01:07.900
And so now we're just dealing with this piece alone that might be useful here at the beginning.

01:08.020 --> 01:15.550
So I'll hit the period key on the numpad to frame that up so the center of my tumble here is at that

01:15.610 --> 01:18.910
piece of geometry and let's test this out.

01:18.910 --> 01:28.600
So once again if I add a subdivision surface modifier just to test how this is going to look I can see

01:28.600 --> 01:35.810
that if I increase the view to two I get it it's kind of curvy here on the corners.

01:35.920 --> 01:43.420
I'll also hit smooth over here on the Tools tab under shading tab into edit mode and press control are

01:43.420 --> 01:49.700
to insert an edge loop here and I'll drag it down just a bit like that.

01:49.990 --> 01:58.930
And I'll also do the same thing over here like this and drag it to the in there and maybe one over here

01:58.930 --> 01:59.670
as well.

02:02.520 --> 02:07.670
So that tightens up those corners just a little bit better.

02:07.860 --> 02:11.090
In addition maybe I should do one up here at the top.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.090
Like so.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.560
So let's try this.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.850
Let's go to the sculptor mode here.

02:21.780 --> 02:31.440
And I'll go ahead and remove the subdivision surface modifier and let's go ahead and add multi resolution

02:31.680 --> 02:36.870
modifier and I'll subdivide it several times.

02:36.870 --> 02:43.450
Let's go let's go and go with 4 right up front and see what that does for us.

02:43.530 --> 02:49.870
I want to make sure that the curve graph here is on the default one.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.670
Yeah it looks good.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.320
And let's just start testing this out.

02:55.770 --> 02:59.150
So if I laid down a stroke here how does that look.

02:59.980 --> 03:07.300
OK but I've got the mirror on I've got the X mirror on and I don't think I need that for this.

03:07.300 --> 03:15.640
So I come down here to symmetry lock and I'll just turn this off I'll turn off the X mirror because

03:15.640 --> 03:21.240
I don't want it to be exactly symmetrical for something like this.

03:21.250 --> 03:25.840
All right so back up here I'll increase the strength of BET and let's give this a try.

03:25.840 --> 03:31.500
So here is how it's going to look and that doesn't look too bad.

03:31.540 --> 03:38.320
In addition I think I may come over here to the smooth stroke and let's test this out.

03:38.320 --> 03:44.250
I want to be able to draw fairly straight lines here.

03:44.650 --> 03:48.840
So I'll just start from the top just draw straight down.

03:48.870 --> 03:53.680
I think I'll hold the control key down and drag along here.

03:53.950 --> 04:04.130
So I get a cut in right next to that bulge out and then for the next two and I'll bulge it out a bit.

04:04.170 --> 04:05.400
Try this at

04:12.830 --> 04:13.750
or when you go

04:16.820 --> 04:23.750
and now I will try and get an edge up right here along the side of it.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.870
I like that.

04:27.340 --> 04:32.200
I think I'll bring back everything else and go back to object mode here.

04:32.380 --> 04:42.430
Increase the preview up to four and I'll press alt h to bring these back and maybe even bring back the

04:42.430 --> 04:43.070
character here.

04:43.090 --> 04:47.940
Let's do that just to get a sense of what we're doing here.

04:48.010 --> 04:51.490
I think I need a little bit more information.

04:51.490 --> 04:57.290
This doesn't give me what the Cluff looks like at the bottom here I think what I'll do.

04:57.460 --> 05:01.780
I've got another reference image here.

05:01.810 --> 05:02.460
Try this.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.430
Let's take a look at this.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.200
This one here.

05:05.200 --> 05:10.060
Cloth one it's got more information about what happens at the bottom of the cloth here someone open

05:10.060 --> 05:11.620
this one up as well.

05:11.770 --> 05:15.340
Maybe zoom in on this stuff down here.

05:16.000 --> 05:16.570
Yeah.

05:16.630 --> 05:22.120
I just always need some sort of a reference to help me.

05:22.180 --> 05:26.650
It's very difficult for me to do things right out of my head.

05:26.740 --> 05:36.600
It looks to me like the wrinkles are the creases get deeper as the cloth comes down to the bottom.

05:36.610 --> 05:39.740
So I need to keep that in mind I think as well.

05:39.790 --> 05:42.160
So let's continue here.

05:42.160 --> 05:52.030
I'm going to adjust the size of my brush here and maybe what I'll do is as I begin up at the top I'll

05:52.120 --> 06:00.760
have a light stroke and then maybe kind of really hunkered down as I get closer to the bottom like this

06:02.210 --> 06:03.360
like that.

06:03.670 --> 06:06.250
And I'll try and do the same thing here.

06:06.330 --> 06:13.410
I'll hold the control key and do a light stroke and then really push down as I get near the bottom.

06:14.800 --> 06:22.270
Yeah I think that's looking a little bit better so it's that change in pressure on the tablet that I

06:22.270 --> 06:23.680
think is going to help.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.920
So I'll continue with this all begin up here.

06:27.970 --> 06:31.390
Maybe I'll change the width start up here at the top.

06:31.390 --> 06:35.340
Very lightly.

06:35.530 --> 06:44.040
And then as I come down or really push down something like that and we go I think that's looking a little

06:44.040 --> 06:44.570
bit better.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.410
I like that.

06:46.410 --> 06:48.810
And I'll work on crease here.

06:48.810 --> 06:54.700
I'll do it very lightly up here and then really push it in as I get down here.

06:56.010 --> 06:56.550
Yeah.

06:56.940 --> 06:57.330
OK.

06:57.330 --> 07:04.720
So that's helping I think and with the strength how I'm getting a stronger stroke as I push in harder.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.000
I've got this turned on right here.

07:07.150 --> 07:12.090
So enabling the tablet pressure sensitivity for strength.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.510
I don't have it for radius and that's something that I could try.

07:16.510 --> 07:23.530
So as it gets down to the bottom of the cloth maybe the width of the fold gets bigger as well we can

07:23.530 --> 07:34.170
try that so I'll turn that on LIT's turn on smooth stroke and I'll begin up here very lightly and then

07:34.170 --> 07:40.800
as I push down you can see the width of the stroke get bigger with the serve as the circle gets bigger

07:40.800 --> 07:41.910
there.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.370
So yeah that's kind of kind of nice.

07:46.870 --> 07:53.440
Let's do that with cutting in as well so all we do this and what I'll do is I'll cut in holding the

07:53.440 --> 07:55.720
control key right up here.

07:56.150 --> 08:04.100
It Down and you can see as I push a little bit harder that circle gets a little bit bigger it down like

08:04.100 --> 08:07.260
that we go.

08:07.500 --> 08:13.920
So there we have our cloth tunic thing on the front to bring everything back.

08:13.920 --> 08:20.960
I need to go back to object mode then press alt H and bring everything back.

08:20.980 --> 08:21.360
All right.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.750
So we have that.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.100
It's not too bad.

08:25.530 --> 08:33.090
Now let's go around to the back and do this one here so I'll select just this one shift h to isolate

08:33.250 --> 08:38.580
and press the period key on the numpad to zoom in.

08:39.630 --> 08:42.100
And let's work on this one.

08:42.330 --> 08:47.220
Once again I need to tab into edit mode and add some edge loops will do that.

08:47.220 --> 08:52.080
I'll add one here so that'll kind of help hold those edges.

08:52.410 --> 08:57.740
I'll add a modifier a multi resolution modifier here.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.150
And let's take the subdivision level up pretty high.

09:02.150 --> 09:05.600
Once again I think it four was what I had it before.

09:05.830 --> 09:09.670
And let's click on smooth shading to make sure we have that.

09:09.890 --> 09:10.400
And there we go.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.560
That looks pretty good.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.810
So let's go through the same process here.

09:13.910 --> 09:22.000
I'm going to go back to sculpt mode and with the pressure sensitivity turned on for both of these both

09:22.000 --> 09:29.990
the radius and the strength I will come in here and start creating some more wrinkles.

09:29.990 --> 09:30.470
All right.

09:30.470 --> 09:35.420
So let me make the brush a little bigger and I'll begin right up here.

09:35.480 --> 09:47.870
Gently lightly doing this and then are really hunkering down as I get to the bottom and I'll cut in

09:47.870 --> 09:51.430
on the sides with that holding the control key down.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.520
And I'll do the same thing over here.

09:57.740 --> 09:59.190
Maybe a little bit bigger this time

10:09.240 --> 10:16.430
and I'll just continue doing this and try and build these up build the wrinkles up for this piece of

10:16.430 --> 10:19.070
cloth as well.

10:19.070 --> 10:19.540
All right.

10:19.550 --> 10:25.750
So we've got that let's go back to object mode here and bring everything back with old age.

10:25.760 --> 10:31.030
And so we've got our back and our front here.

10:32.510 --> 10:37.500
Let's now work on this piece here.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.910
Let's go ahead and add a multi resolution modifier.

10:43.030 --> 10:51.620
We can also smooth it over here under the Tools tab and let's increase it again maybe two subdivision

10:51.620 --> 11:02.780
for here I'm going to press alt H and I want to select this and the front and the back.

11:03.150 --> 11:07.150
And now it's hide everything else with shift date.

11:07.650 --> 11:13.740
And now I can see what it is I need to do and what is I I don't need to do because I don't need to work

11:13.740 --> 11:17.640
on what's under here so I'll just select this one.

11:18.660 --> 11:20.570
And let's go to sculpt mode.

11:22.210 --> 11:32.690
And we go and let's start creating the wrinkles here so I press the F key to change the radius.

11:32.690 --> 11:35.180
I'll turn on pressure sensitivity.

11:35.650 --> 11:40.860
Let's change the smooth stroke.

11:41.230 --> 11:46.560
Let's increase the radius and increase the radius and see if that changes anything.

11:47.510 --> 11:49.580
That'll extend to that line.

11:49.580 --> 11:56.280
So we have a little bit more time to play before it begins sculpting there.

11:56.850 --> 12:05.360
Let's try this is going to do some basic sculpting on the here to get it push out.

12:06.530 --> 12:09.090
And then I'll go back in and do the cutting.

12:11.420 --> 12:12.730
With the control key.

12:12.770 --> 12:14.900
But for right now I'm just going to try this.

12:14.900 --> 12:20.710
I'm just changing the brush size periodically changing how hard I push down.

12:22.380 --> 12:27.100
Just to try and get these to look a little more like cloth.

12:27.120 --> 12:27.800
Here we go.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.090
OK.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.470
That looks pretty good.

12:29.600 --> 12:33.000
I'll continue over here on this other side same kind of thing.

12:33.210 --> 12:40.380
Before I go in and cut it in with the control key I'll just get all the ridges that push out

12:46.510 --> 12:47.570
and then we go.

12:47.620 --> 12:47.980
All right.

12:47.980 --> 12:50.040
That's looking pretty good.

12:50.050 --> 12:57.560
Let's go back and cut in on a few of these to deepen the creases a little bit.

12:57.610 --> 13:06.770
So I'll go down to a smaller brush here and press control and just begin cutting in some of the like

13:06.800 --> 13:12.690
that.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.250
All right.

13:13.290 --> 13:16.710
So we've got our tunic pretty much done.

13:16.710 --> 13:21.700
Let's go back to object mode and press alt H.

13:22.190 --> 13:23.070
And there we go.

13:23.070 --> 13:28.620
So we've got our cloth tunic looking pretty good there.

13:30.470 --> 13:36.800
I think the next task will be to work on the belts and straps and maybe try and mirror some of this

13:36.800 --> 13:41.650
seam work here on those belts and straps and stuff.

13:41.810 --> 13:43.860
So we'll see if we can do that next time.
