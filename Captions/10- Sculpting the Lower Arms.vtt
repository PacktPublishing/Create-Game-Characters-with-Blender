00:00.540 --> 00:05.650
Well today I'd like to work on the four arms of the character.

00:05.940 --> 00:13.380
It's interesting though I realized that if I go over to the character images screen lay out you can

00:13.380 --> 00:23.860
see that his forearms are covered with these kind of cuffs and the same with the lower legs.

00:24.080 --> 00:29.740
For me the forearms are a difficult part of the human anatomy.

00:29.740 --> 00:31.920
I never quite get it correct.

00:32.090 --> 00:34.780
And it's interesting that I actually drew these things over it.

00:34.790 --> 00:39.970
I don't know if subconsciously I was just trying to get out of doing the upper arms.

00:40.670 --> 00:43.290
I think it's kind of funny that I did that.

00:43.440 --> 00:49.840
I'm going to go back to the default view here and bring back my character on one.

00:50.060 --> 00:52.680
So let's go ahead and work on the forearms.

00:52.730 --> 00:56.530
I'm not going to do too much detail for this since they will be covered.

00:56.540 --> 00:59.920
But we at least need to get the basic forms in.

00:59.930 --> 01:08.060
So to begin with what I'm going to do is work on the back of the arm the elbow area now the back of

01:08.060 --> 01:13.580
the arm has this area right above the elbow going into the triceps.

01:13.580 --> 01:22.340
That's kind of tendon and bone that makes it kind of flat coming off of the actual elbow joint there.

01:22.340 --> 01:28.640
So what I need to do is figure out where that point is I'm going to use the scope to draw brush for

01:28.640 --> 01:33.510
now let me see if I can just place this so it looks fairly.

01:33.770 --> 01:37.180
Let's just pretend like that's the elbow for now.

01:38.580 --> 01:46.720
It looks like it should be down a little bit lower maybe when we do this let me place it right about

01:46.720 --> 01:47.170
here.

01:47.170 --> 01:49.860
For now let's see how that works.

01:49.870 --> 01:52.260
That may be a little high.

01:52.410 --> 01:54.330
They may extend it down here.

01:55.060 --> 01:59.680
So from here there's kind of a flat area.

02:00.010 --> 02:05.170
And what I can do is actually mask this area out and flatten it a bit.

02:05.170 --> 02:05.960
Let's do that.

02:05.980 --> 02:15.940
I'll take the mask tool and just right around in here I'm going to go ahead and just mask this off right

02:15.940 --> 02:16.820
here.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.020
See how this works.

02:22.630 --> 02:26.290
And then as we've done before I'll invert that with control.

02:26.770 --> 02:32.850
And now this area I'd like to come in and just try and flatten this let's see how this works.

02:36.150 --> 02:36.680
There we go.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.250
That didn't take too much.

02:38.270 --> 02:40.300
Something like this.

02:40.700 --> 02:50.180
And then for these kinds of things what I can do is invert that again and then come back with something

02:50.180 --> 02:58.540
like the inflate brush here and gently kind of inflate the area around that.

02:58.550 --> 03:02.000
So it kind of bulges around that area.

03:06.970 --> 03:12.730
All right so since we're at a lower resolution we're not going to get a whole lot of detail here and

03:12.730 --> 03:14.060
that's fine.

03:14.080 --> 03:20.890
I'm just trying to block in the general shapes here.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.200
All right.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.110
So there's that flat part going to the elbow here.

03:25.220 --> 03:33.350
We've got the tricep kind of wrapping around it and now I want to draw that bone going down from the

03:33.350 --> 03:35.820
elbow to the wrist here.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.400
What is that the ulna.

03:38.450 --> 03:47.680
Let me use the scopes draw a brush and I just want to bring it to hint at it from here right straight

03:47.680 --> 03:50.000
down like that.

03:50.050 --> 04:00.670
So we'll use that as a kind of guide to create the muscles on either side of that for the forearm and

04:00.670 --> 04:07.560
for this I want to mask out an area that begins by coming out of this area.

04:07.570 --> 04:14.220
Right here it kind of inserts between the triceps and this Brocky Alice I believe.

04:14.620 --> 04:20.460
And I want to curve it around to the front of the arm and come down here to the thumb.

04:20.680 --> 04:26.950
So I'll go to the mask tool and let's start doing this here.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.570
Bring it out of here around here.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.690
Let's bring this on to the other side of the arm.

04:38.950 --> 04:40.990
And maybe straight down.

04:42.030 --> 04:51.280
Like this and over here it's going to come to that point and follow it down.

04:52.240 --> 04:59.080
And to here now we haven't really blocked out the hands yet so that might cause us a little bit of a

04:59.080 --> 05:00.780
problem but I think we can do this.

05:00.780 --> 05:06.750
I'd like to try and get the bulk of it done before I work on the hand.

05:06.750 --> 05:10.720
So let me fill this in.

05:12.770 --> 05:20.030
And let's see if we can do with this control to invert the selection for the mask and back the clay

05:20.030 --> 05:26.520
strips brush and let's see about doing this.

05:26.520 --> 05:35.670
Now I'm going to just begin laying down some form here and the whole thing kind of twists around the

05:35.670 --> 05:50.230
arm so many strokes kind of like this.

05:50.240 --> 05:56.360
Now there's a huge temptation at this point in time for me to increase the subdivision levels so that

05:56.360 --> 06:01.070
I can get more detail in here and I'm resisting that urge.

06:01.070 --> 06:09.560
It's hard though you really want to increase the subdivision levels so you can get all the little striations

06:09.560 --> 06:11.860
and nooks and crannies and everything.

06:11.870 --> 06:19.900
But if you can resist the urge at this point in time I think it'll do you a good.

06:20.070 --> 06:24.960
So I'm just trying to keep an eye on the form as I go here.

06:25.050 --> 06:32.670
One thing about it that I probably haven't mentioned yet is I use a lot of reference images I've got

06:33.240 --> 06:35.520
just because I'm interested in this kind of thing.

06:35.520 --> 06:40.140
I've got images and posters on my wall of human anatomy.

06:40.140 --> 06:51.150
I've got a very large human anatomy poster right above my computer so I can just look up and see the

06:51.150 --> 06:52.500
human anatomy.

06:52.500 --> 07:01.860
So my suggestion is to not try and do this just out of your head really have some reference images in

07:01.860 --> 07:05.410
front of you whether you want to google it.

07:05.460 --> 07:15.860
There's lots of human anatomy charts and images out on Google or if you want to get one of these posters.

07:15.870 --> 07:22.190
Mine is from a place called freedom of teach dot com.

07:22.200 --> 07:22.680
All right.

07:22.680 --> 07:29.150
So I've got the general forms here I think of this part of the arm.

07:29.360 --> 07:35.360
I'm going to now see if I can work on the other side the other side is always kind of tricky.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.980
I'm going to clear the mask with.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.810
Him and then let's try and figure out how we're going to do this.

07:42.810 --> 07:47.690
I think I'd better hide the character so I can get in there a little bit easier.

07:47.700 --> 07:55.950
So what I'm going to do is bring this guy over here and hit the H key and I'm just going to hide this

07:55.950 --> 07:57.560
part of the character here.

07:59.400 --> 08:06.170
And we go that will help me get in under here a little bit easier.

08:06.210 --> 08:13.110
Now if you're ever having trouble tumbling around a certain point in sculped mode like I've got I'm

08:13.110 --> 08:20.520
having trouble moving around here and I want to tumble around just this part of the arm but it's probably

08:20.520 --> 08:27.210
tumbling around the center of the grid at this point in time making it very difficult to get in to right

08:28.020 --> 08:29.700
where I want to be here.

08:29.700 --> 08:36.120
One thing you can do is put your cursor over the place where you want to center up the tumble and press

08:36.240 --> 08:39.330
alt F and it will zoom in to that point.

08:39.330 --> 08:47.340
And now you can tumble around that location so that makes things a little easier.

08:48.690 --> 08:55.800
So now for this part I think I'm just going to mask out this area that I've haven't sculpted yet and

08:55.800 --> 08:56.710
work on that.

08:56.790 --> 09:03.180
So I'll go back to the mask tool and I'll just mask this out here.

09:08.340 --> 09:14.610
This is going to come out to this line right here and it's actually going to overlap that line just

09:14.610 --> 09:15.130
a bit

09:17.740 --> 09:22.070
and like this and fill this in all right.

09:22.070 --> 09:24.510
So now invert it control.

09:24.560 --> 09:34.050
I backed the clay strips or back here's the clay strips and then let's work on this a bit.

09:46.680 --> 09:54.530
All right so there we go I've got a little bit of form laid out for that part of the forearm.

09:54.580 --> 10:00.030
I've tried to keep it fairly thin down by the wrist area here.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.880
And I'm trying to keep an eye on the forms of this part of the forearm too and I may even have made

10:07.880 --> 10:10.210
the elbow a little bit too high.

10:10.370 --> 10:12.360
It may need to come down a bit.

10:12.590 --> 10:15.960
But generally speaking I think that's pretty good for now.

10:16.250 --> 10:24.300
I will probably then go and work on the hands next here let's bring everything back.

10:24.300 --> 10:32.860
I'll choose him to undo the mask and I'll press old H to bring back the rest of the character.

10:33.290 --> 10:37.530
And so here is what we've got for the forearms.

10:37.820 --> 10:43.010
I think I will probably work a little bit more in this area here.

10:44.570 --> 10:56.820
Maybe bring up the form a little bit more in here and maybe even cut it a bit here.

10:56.850 --> 11:03.600
Now ultimately I'm going to want this to insert more in between these two muscles here of the forearm

11:03.840 --> 11:07.640
and I'll want more of definition.

11:07.650 --> 11:14.550
This is all still pretty rough and we're still just suggesting the forms but I think that's a good beginning

11:14.550 --> 11:18.070
for our forearm here.

11:18.330 --> 11:21.990
The good part about it is as I said his it will be covered up.

11:22.200 --> 11:27.930
So whether I did that subconsciously or not that's going to help me out.
