00:00.720 --> 00:04.170
Well it's negative one degree here this morning.

00:04.170 --> 00:08.910
And I figured it's a good time to stay inside and record a video.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.870
So I hope it's warmer wherever you are.

00:12.120 --> 00:18.140
But let's start working on the texture painting for our game character.

00:18.140 --> 00:23.100
What I'd like to do is paint on the low poly character.

00:23.100 --> 00:29.120
I think it'll just be easier in terms of the speed at which my computer can handle things.

00:29.130 --> 00:37.620
I think if I were to try and paint this high poly character at eleven point five million tries it just

00:37.620 --> 00:39.560
wouldn't work out well.

00:39.750 --> 00:42.680
And also trying to U-V map this is going to be a pain.

00:42.700 --> 00:49.830
And we've already got our U-V map ready for us here with the low poly character.

00:49.920 --> 00:56.220
So going to work on texture painting this version of the model however that brings up some interesting

00:56.220 --> 01:02.990
issues like the sculpted pieces on the arm band here.

01:04.260 --> 01:10.170
You can see them plainly here in the high poly sculped But if you go over to the low poly you don't

01:10.170 --> 01:11.310
see them.

01:11.310 --> 01:18.030
So how am I going to know where to paint if I want those pieces to be a different color than the rest

01:18.030 --> 01:19.930
of the of the glove here.

01:20.160 --> 01:26.400
What we'll do is we'll use the normal map and the ambient occlusion map to give us a sense of where

01:26.400 --> 01:29.360
those details are while we're texture painting.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.350
But we've got some work to do to get to that point.

01:33.350 --> 01:35.310
So let's get started.

01:35.310 --> 01:42.790
First of all what I'm going to do is change from the cycle's render engine to the Blendr internal.

01:42.810 --> 01:48.900
The reason why I'm doing this is because I still feel that the texture painting tools in the blender

01:48.900 --> 01:52.070
internal are still more intuitive.

01:52.080 --> 01:58.590
Maybe it's just because I've used them longer I don't know but I still feel there are more features

01:58.620 --> 02:00.850
and it's just a little more intuitive.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.390
So I'm going to go with the blender internal here.

02:03.420 --> 02:08.430
The next thing I need to do is open up the properties panel with the end key and I'm going to scroll

02:08.430 --> 02:21.040
down here and go to the shading area right here and change from multi textural to Geo SL and they'll

02:21.050 --> 02:25.260
allow me to see what's going on in the viewport a lot better as I text your pain.

02:25.490 --> 02:31.140
But in doing that I need to create a light as well just to be able to see the texture painting.

02:31.310 --> 02:38.370
So I'm going to go over to the Create tab and scroll down and I'm going to just create a Hemmy light

02:39.240 --> 02:41.470
and I'll just drag that up a bit.

02:42.410 --> 02:49.880
And move it over to the side and maybe move it out in front like this and I'll just hit the key and

02:49.880 --> 03:01.140
rotate it around so it points more at the character like so and I might even while I'm here duplicate

03:01.170 --> 03:07.050
this with shift D and just move it toward the back of the character and then rotate it.

03:07.050 --> 03:12.390
So it's pointing at the back as well just so I can see both sides equally as well.

03:13.380 --> 03:20.120
I'm going to press the end key to close that propertys panel and now I think I'll select the character

03:20.150 --> 03:26.800
go over to the materials panel and if you have a material over here go ahead and delete it.

03:26.840 --> 03:31.910
I don't have one but I'm just going to click the new button here and create a new material.

03:31.940 --> 03:37.570
I'd like to change my viewport shading here from solid to texture.

03:38.830 --> 03:47.200
And then I can change from object mode now to texture paint.

03:47.240 --> 03:54.200
Now once I do that you can see over here it's telling me that I'm missing texture slot and the slots

03:54.200 --> 04:02.390
tab is here and you usually add texture slots here but since we don't have a texture slot we can't see

04:02.390 --> 04:05.000
the texture painting tools yet.

04:05.420 --> 04:13.160
So what I'll do is go ahead and add a texture paint slot and we can choose any number of types here.

04:13.160 --> 04:19.680
I'm going to choose diffuse color just because I want to begin with a base color for the character.

04:19.700 --> 04:25.160
So I click this and let's call this base color

04:29.440 --> 04:36.940
and let's go ahead and make the texture size 2048.

04:37.230 --> 04:41.060
That'll give us a little more resolution than 10:24 I think.

04:41.060 --> 04:47.360
When I break down the normal map and the ambient occlusion map I think I take those out at 10:24.

04:47.360 --> 04:56.090
I'm not sure but if I did it will still work when we bring them in as a reference so we can take a look

04:56.090 --> 04:57.500
at that too.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.200
All right I'll go ahead and click OK.

05:00.710 --> 05:01.910
And there we go.

05:01.940 --> 05:06.830
Now we have the character with a texture slot on it.

05:06.830 --> 05:08.930
It's black which is fine.

05:09.170 --> 05:10.790
We're going to be painting over that.

05:10.970 --> 05:17.980
And now you can see I've got over here in the slots tab that base color texture slot.

05:17.990 --> 05:26.150
Now we're over here next to the materials panel is the texture panel and you can see here we have a

05:26.150 --> 05:28.070
texture layer called diffuse color.

05:28.070 --> 05:31.880
Now this is really the same thing as this.

05:31.880 --> 05:35.290
I wish you would update the name but it doesn't.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.670
But I'm going to go ahead and do it my self.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.900
So going to call this base color.

05:40.970 --> 05:46.940
Now one last thing I want to do in just setting up blender for texture painting is just to create a

05:46.940 --> 05:48.800
new screen lay out.

05:48.800 --> 05:57.290
So I'll come up here to the default screen lay out click the plus and I'll call this texture painting.

05:58.760 --> 06:02.690
And I'm doing that because I want to create one more window here.

06:02.690 --> 06:11.570
I want to just drag this over from that little corner tab drag it over and I'll change this window now

06:11.930 --> 06:13.870
to use the image editor.

06:14.970 --> 06:18.420
And we should be able to see our U-V map now.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.390
OK we've got one more thing that we need to do here.

06:21.390 --> 06:24.160
If I tried to paint on this now.

06:24.780 --> 06:34.020
This over here is the settings for my brush and my strength is at Point 7 the radius here you can see

06:34.020 --> 06:40.550
if I drag the radius up the brush gets bigger if I drag it down it gets smaller.

06:40.710 --> 06:47.630
You can also press the F key to increase the size of the brush here and then click.

06:47.760 --> 06:57.380
Or you can also press shift F and change the strength so make it stronger or weaker in the strength.

06:57.870 --> 07:00.550
But what you want to do is just test the paint here.

07:00.570 --> 07:08.670
If I set up my brush for this kind of size and just click and drag on here you can see I get a paint

07:08.670 --> 07:13.400
stroke but the problem is I'm not getting anything in here.

07:13.410 --> 07:14.940
Over in the U-V map.

07:15.090 --> 07:23.100
Ultimately what we're doing here in drawing or painting on the 3-D character is we want that information

07:23.100 --> 07:30.060
to be transferred to a U-V map so that we can take it into a game engine like unity just like we did

07:30.060 --> 07:32.850
with the normal map and the ambient occlusion map.

07:33.210 --> 07:41.100
So what we need is some sort of a canvas for the paint to transfer onto to just press command Z to undo

07:41.100 --> 07:41.770
that.

07:42.090 --> 07:47.730
So what we can do is just come down here to this pull out menu and we should see that image that comes

07:47.730 --> 07:51.150
along or that goes along with that texture paint slot.

07:51.360 --> 07:57.810
So I'm just going to click on that base color image and now that we have that image there if we come

07:57.810 --> 08:05.460
back over here to the character and paint on it we should see that paint show up here on the U-V map

08:06.120 --> 08:08.360
so you can see as we paint the character.

08:08.370 --> 08:12.380
All we're really doing is painting directly onto that U-V canvas.

08:12.390 --> 08:18.150
It's just kind of a trick to allow us to feel like we're painting on the character.

08:18.150 --> 08:25.200
Now one thing about it this image is a separate file from the Blendr seen file.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.770
Here let me do this real quick.

08:27.810 --> 08:32.210
You can tell that by this little asterisks right down here by the image menu.

08:32.310 --> 08:37.830
What that's telling us is that this particular image has not yet been saved or the hard drive.

08:37.830 --> 08:41.010
So we need to save this to the hard drive.

08:41.040 --> 08:48.300
In addition to saving our scene to do that we can come down here to image and the first time we save

08:48.300 --> 08:56.550
it we need to choose Save As image and we can just keep that base color name and that's fine and save

08:56.550 --> 08:57.620
image.

08:57.660 --> 09:03.670
Now you can see the Asterix is gone and if paint on the character and change it somehow.

09:03.690 --> 09:05.850
Now you can see the Asterix is back.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.240
If I click on the image.

09:07.260 --> 09:15.210
Now we have this save image menu item which is alt S. so I can just press alt s and it will save the

09:15.210 --> 09:21.900
image but that's different than pressing control or command s to save the scene.

09:21.900 --> 09:30.450
So when you are texture painting you need to be sure and press both controller command s and Altez to

09:30.450 --> 09:33.630
be sure and save the scene and the image.

09:33.690 --> 09:34.320
All right.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.900
Let me hit command Z to undo that.

09:37.920 --> 09:42.490
So now we have our blender interface set up to begin texture painting.

09:42.510 --> 09:47.210
We've got our image canvas set up over here in the U-V Ed..

09:47.280 --> 09:54.490
So in the next video we'll use the face selection mask to begin laying down the base colors of our character.
