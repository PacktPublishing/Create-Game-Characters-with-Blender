00:00.940 --> 00:06.710
Well I've taken some time and worked on the little tunic here.

00:06.760 --> 00:13.780
Let me press alt Allt to center that up and zoom in and tumble around that you can see I've just tried

00:13.780 --> 00:22.420
to highlight the folds by painting on some shadow and some highlights here just to try and have the

00:22.420 --> 00:27.860
textures emphasize or be compatible with the normal map.

00:27.910 --> 00:32.920
I think today I'm going to work on the boots of the character down here.

00:32.920 --> 00:37.300
You can see I've got kind of a reference image here for the boots.

00:37.300 --> 00:44.110
These are not exactly the same of course but I like the different colors here I like the textures and

00:44.110 --> 00:48.100
the different shades between the boot and the straps.

00:48.100 --> 00:52.650
I'm going to switch back over to the other color palette that I was using.

00:52.920 --> 00:58.560
I'm on the cloth one now with these colors on the switch back over to the straps and metal one.

00:58.660 --> 01:02.710
And here are the colors that I used mainly for the leather.

01:02.710 --> 01:08.220
However now that I think about it I may just want to begin sampling new colors right off here.

01:08.260 --> 01:10.130
So let's go ahead and create a new palette.

01:10.150 --> 01:13.090
Let's do that because these colors aren't really doing it for me I think.

01:13.090 --> 01:15.610
I want to sample it right off of there.

01:15.970 --> 01:22.660
So I'm going to come over here and click the plus create a new palette and let's just call this boots.

01:22.930 --> 01:28.340
Right now I'm not going to need this texture on the brush or just get rid of that.

01:28.710 --> 01:32.380
And let's start picking some new colors here.

01:32.380 --> 01:39.890
I like this dark color on top of this boot over here where it's worn like that one.

01:39.910 --> 01:45.100
Let's see if I can get that one to hold the key down and see if I can find that color.

01:47.060 --> 01:49.070
How about that.

01:49.090 --> 01:50.080
That's kind of nice.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.780
Let's go with that.

01:51.910 --> 01:55.050
Let's look for a lighter color now in here.

01:55.570 --> 01:58.750
Maybe something in the range of here

02:01.460 --> 02:02.710
like that.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.840
Let's start working with those.

02:05.870 --> 02:10.610
So now even though I didn't want that particular texture on the brush I do think I am going to need

02:10.610 --> 02:14.930
a texture whether be image based or procedural.

02:15.230 --> 02:17.830
Here's a nice one let me go back to this one.

02:18.260 --> 02:19.680
That's kind of nice.

02:21.150 --> 02:26.370
Let's change the brush mapping to random.

02:26.610 --> 02:28.530
Let's increase the jitter a bit.

02:28.530 --> 02:30.480
Increase the spacing a bit.

02:30.570 --> 02:34.970
So we kind of lay it down in a relatively random way.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.790
We've got the dark color on here.

02:38.790 --> 02:41.840
Let's go ahead and mask this.

02:41.860 --> 02:48.960
I'll come down here to the face masking make sure that nothing selected with the key and I'll hover

02:48.960 --> 02:51.490
over that and hit the LP here.

02:52.550 --> 02:58.910
Let's try this and maybe even down here.

02:59.100 --> 02:59.870
So let's try this.

02:59.870 --> 03:06.780
I'll just draw that down and yeah you can see I'm getting some Yeah I'm getting some kind of blotching

03:06.780 --> 03:08.070
is there that's kind of good.

03:08.070 --> 03:15.840
Let me go find where the boot is I think this is it here.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.780
All right.

03:16.970 --> 03:18.140
So let's see what we can do.

03:18.140 --> 03:24.350
I'm going to increase the brush size and just do some random painting on here just to get kind of a

03:24.350 --> 03:26.010
worn look.

03:32.110 --> 03:36.060
I mean do some down here as well on the soul.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.630
Probably not going to see that ever.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.860
But that's OK.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.150
We know it's there.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.050
All right.

03:42.140 --> 03:44.560
So now we've got some of that dark color.

03:44.570 --> 03:51.920
Now let's go back to the light and I'm going to reduce the jitter reduce the spacing a bit and let's

03:51.920 --> 03:53.240
see what I can do with this.

03:53.240 --> 04:00.120
Now I'm just looking for a very light striations here.

04:03.070 --> 04:08.250
And some of this is going to be covered up by the straps and that's fine.

04:09.540 --> 04:14.230
But maybe try and emphasize some of the wrinkles going across here.

04:15.410 --> 04:20.480
And maybe scuff marks along the toes I'm seeing here

04:27.150 --> 04:33.640
let me bring that strength down a bit with shift F and pull out a bit to reduce the strength

04:38.640 --> 04:42.380
and then I'll try and highlight some of these areas as well.

04:42.530 --> 04:49.010
The wrinkles on the back.

04:49.180 --> 04:49.450
All right.

04:49.450 --> 04:56.690
So there we're beginning to get some of the texture on there some of that light scuff mark type of texture

04:57.590 --> 05:05.560
and I feel like I do need it up on top a bit maybe where he pulls on the boot and it gets worn a bit

05:05.560 --> 05:06.440
up here.

05:08.690 --> 05:12.560
So we've got that dark color and the light color.

05:12.560 --> 05:17.660
There's also this reddish that seems to be a different color than the base.

05:17.660 --> 05:22.790
Let me capture some of that right in here.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.530
And let's use this for this.

05:25.530 --> 05:35.550
I think I will increase the jitter a little bit more increase the spacing some and lay this down kind

05:35.550 --> 05:37.870
of wire like this.

05:37.890 --> 05:39.750
Let's try this and see how it works.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.870
All right let's take a look at creating these straps.

05:46.870 --> 05:50.800
I think I'm just going to go ahead and paint directly on.

05:50.950 --> 05:54.060
I might even create a new slot just in case.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.600
I kind of messed something up.

05:56.770 --> 06:03.850
So I'm going to go ahead and create a new texture slot right here and I'm going to do this just so I

06:03.850 --> 06:10.020
have more control I can adjust the blend mode and I can erase when I need to.

06:10.210 --> 06:12.330
And I'll just call this straps.

06:12.370 --> 06:19.420
And of course we need to be sure and change the alpha here and I click on the color swatch and take

06:19.420 --> 06:21.610
the alpha down all the way.

06:21.820 --> 06:28.540
So we're painting through it and can see the other layers beneath it.

06:28.540 --> 06:30.670
I think I've been using 2048.

06:30.670 --> 06:31.660
All right.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.470
Let's do that.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.200
And click OK.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.230
So here is my new paint Lehre.

06:40.430 --> 06:47.740
I'm going to switch back to my boots here and let's go back to the Tools tab and let me sample this.

06:47.740 --> 06:54.720
This looks a lot lighter or a little bit different than that other light color so I'll grab that.

06:54.940 --> 06:58.460
And let's come in here and see if we can do.

06:58.790 --> 07:01.250
Looks like the strength is a little too strong.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.220
I'll bring that down.

07:03.310 --> 07:05.300
And let's go in and try this.

07:05.300 --> 07:10.760
Yes I'm going to use this I think to work on these straps here.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.540
Again I don't know I'll be going down here.

07:13.660 --> 07:28.810
Let's see how what we can do with this.

07:29.050 --> 07:31.240
Yes I'm going to continue with this.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.450
I'm going to continue painting those straps.

07:34.450 --> 07:43.000
I'm also probably going to have to come in and do a little dark line shading to separate the strap from

07:43.090 --> 07:44.650
the rest of the boot.

07:45.370 --> 07:50.680
And I think I'll also be able to adjust the blend mode of the layer down here.

07:50.680 --> 07:53.090
I don't know we can try multiply.

07:53.090 --> 07:54.770
Now that's not going to work.

07:55.010 --> 08:01.700
About screen we can try some different types of overlays.

08:01.790 --> 08:05.160
That's not bad to see what we can get.

08:06.390 --> 08:08.290
That's not even too bad either.

08:08.360 --> 08:13.060
So I'll be working with these blend types as well.

08:13.060 --> 08:20.530
So I'll go ahead and begin working on this hopefully try and finish up the boot so we can move on to

08:20.560 --> 08:22.970
another part of the character in the next video.
