00:00.430 --> 00:03.110
Well let's keep going with the read typology.

00:03.110 --> 00:05.290
I'm really hoping we can get this done today.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.600
I'm really looking forward to moving on to the next part.

00:09.020 --> 00:11.060
Let's take a look at these fingers.

00:11.240 --> 00:16.750
I've got the four fingers here and the thumb here.

00:16.820 --> 00:23.380
I'll go ahead and select all of those and press control Jay and join them into all one object.

00:23.390 --> 00:27.950
Now what I'd like to do is mirror them over to the other side.

00:28.040 --> 00:32.310
So the 3D cursor is still down here in the center of the grid.

00:32.390 --> 00:40.190
So all I should need to do is just go to the set origin menu and move the origin to the 3D cursor.

00:40.190 --> 00:48.940
Now let's make sure in the properties panel that the rotation and scale are applied and they're not.

00:49.220 --> 00:52.830
We've got a lot of values here that we don't want.

00:53.090 --> 00:57.900
So let's just press control a and I'll choose rotation and scale.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.380
Then there we go.

00:59.420 --> 01:08.060
Now we should be able to come over here to the modifiers panel add a modifier and choose mirror.

01:08.200 --> 01:08.690
There we go.

01:08.690 --> 01:11.360
So now it's mirrored over to the other side.

01:11.520 --> 01:19.100
I going to go ahead and apply that and then I will join it with this piece here.

01:19.100 --> 01:26.450
So I'll just select the hand's shift select the rest of the body and press control J.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.420
And then we go.

01:29.420 --> 01:38.100
Now for the rest of this little tunic or loincloths or whatever we're going to call it here.

01:38.510 --> 01:47.080
I think what I'd like to do is make a solid piece here so we can't see up her skirt.

01:47.090 --> 01:53.330
Now that might be a little embarrassing and we'd have to do a lot of other modeling that I don't think

01:53.330 --> 01:54.960
we wanted to do with this.

01:55.040 --> 02:02.060
So I'm just going to close this off and I'm also going to then use the skirt the edge up here the skirt.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.580
It's not a skirt is it.

02:03.590 --> 02:07.930
Don't call it a skirt.

02:07.940 --> 02:14.870
Use this edge to extrude up to the belt or use that edge to extrude the belt.

02:14.870 --> 02:21.920
So let's first see if we can close this off a little bit to protect his modesty.

02:21.920 --> 02:30.260
I'm going to select this edge and I'm just going to extrude and Scantlin just a bit.

02:30.410 --> 02:38.390
And then what I'd like to do is scale up and close this off at the top of the of the legs.

02:38.390 --> 02:44.280
So with that edge selected I will press e and I'm going to scale in.

02:44.300 --> 02:54.390
But I'm also going to pull up a bit like this and then B and then scale in and then pull up a bit like

02:54.390 --> 02:54.900
this.

02:54.900 --> 03:04.340
Let me hit the Z key to go to wireframe and we're pretty much to the top there of his legs.

03:04.340 --> 03:12.710
I can always extend those legs up higher if I need to but we'll just go ahead and hit the scale and

03:12.710 --> 03:22.430
pull them up just a little bit more like so and then I'm going to hit one more time and press Allt M

03:23.090 --> 03:25.780
and choose to merge at the center.

03:26.630 --> 03:36.430
And we go right so Z to go back out of wireframe and see you can see I've just created a dome up in

03:36.430 --> 03:40.230
there just to make sure we don't see up the skirt.

03:41.210 --> 03:49.320
Now for the front and back pieces that kind of hang down farther let's go back to the front view I'll

03:49.340 --> 03:53.680
hit the one key on the numpad and the five key.

03:53.750 --> 04:01.270
So it looks like I could extrude this piece out and then extrude it down toward the feet.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.690
So let me try that.

04:03.770 --> 04:10.160
I think what I'd like to do is just some points here to get the basic shape of that front piece first.

04:10.700 --> 04:17.630
And I think I want to work in symmetry so I'm going to press control tab and get a face mode and just

04:17.630 --> 04:26.000
with the Beaky and border select just select half of this piece and then I'm going to delete it with

04:26.090 --> 04:28.300
X and faces.

04:28.900 --> 04:34.780
And now what I want to do is apply a mirror modifier again.

04:36.010 --> 04:41.910
And we go and I'll choose clipping and I'll also adjust it.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.360
Cage here.

04:44.170 --> 04:51.880
Now what I want to do is go to something like vertex mode and select this and either press control V

04:52.180 --> 04:55.540
and go to slide like this.

04:55.570 --> 05:03.090
Which was also shift to B and just began arranging these.

05:03.090 --> 05:09.420
So they kind of have that shape of that front panel.

05:09.470 --> 05:15.910
Now you can also press the G key twice and that will slide that along that edge as well.

05:17.020 --> 05:22.390
Well now that I have the basic shape of that front flap I think when I want to do is go to face mode

05:22.480 --> 05:25.420
and select these faces.

05:25.990 --> 05:32.110
And I like to extrude it out just a little bit just to differentiate it from the main piece.

05:32.140 --> 05:39.530
So that easy and I'll just drag straight out like that.

05:39.580 --> 05:40.310
All right.

05:40.760 --> 05:49.070
Now I'm going to take all of these faces and I want to go back to the front view and take a look at

05:49.130 --> 05:54.070
the drawing and I'm just going to extrude it straight down like this.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.250
Talk about where that ends.

05:58.260 --> 06:01.960
Thinking about how this top piece is going to intersect with the belt.

06:01.980 --> 06:11.340
I think what I want to do is merge these points right here so I'll press out in time and at last and

06:11.340 --> 06:12.840
do the same thing here.

06:15.150 --> 06:20.790
And then I'm going to come back here and do the same thing with this piece back here try and shape it

06:21.270 --> 06:23.990
to how I want it to look.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.410
So once again I'll just select these and shift the

06:32.360 --> 06:40.220
and slide those along that edge and just like with the previous one I selected these faces.

06:40.720 --> 06:45.020
And let's just extrude straight out like that.

06:46.860 --> 06:47.550
Go ahead.

06:47.550 --> 06:50.880
Well I'm up here and collapse these points.

06:52.270 --> 06:53.330
With Allt am

06:56.820 --> 06:58.810
and then extrude these down.

06:59.200 --> 07:05.270
I can always use the other layer right here as a guide.

07:05.290 --> 07:09.370
This is the high resolution layer.

07:10.180 --> 07:14.660
I can use this to extrude down like this

07:18.000 --> 07:21.060
maybe pull it out a bit.

07:21.320 --> 07:25.840
All right let's think about the belt here and now before I do this.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.780
I think I'm going to apply that mirror modifier.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.830
So I'll go ahead and apply that here.

07:33.190 --> 07:38.160
Then go back and now I can scale this out.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.050
Without too much difficulty.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.420
So for this I'll just hit E and then scale out

07:50.080 --> 07:53.870
and then I'll hit me and let's drag this straight up

07:57.880 --> 07:59.640
and then extrude this and again

08:02.170 --> 08:09.220
so now for the lips of the character let's go up and take a look at these.

08:09.610 --> 08:14.870
I think I'll need to look at the side view of my character.

08:14.890 --> 08:21.910
All right so it looks like I just need a little bit more of a lip here and I need to extrude this in

08:21.910 --> 08:23.800
and connect it up.

08:23.800 --> 08:28.010
So with this I think I want to just pull these out just a bit.

08:30.220 --> 08:31.140
Like so

08:33.940 --> 08:37.170
and I also like this whole edge around the mouth.

08:37.180 --> 08:42.740
And let's just extrude this and then scale it in just a bit.

08:42.760 --> 08:48.880
I'm going to scale in the z some scaled in the X just a bit.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.140
And I'll do that again.

08:52.150 --> 08:55.670
I'll take this edge and I'll extrude it.

08:55.850 --> 08:58.390
And this time I scaled again and the Z

09:01.520 --> 09:03.710
will move it all back just a bit.

09:05.330 --> 09:09.590
I like that now I'm going to go ahead and try and hook these up.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.210
I don't know if this will work completely but let's give it a shot.

09:12.230 --> 09:23.370
I'm going to select these two and merge at the center as well as these and these and then I think I

09:23.370 --> 09:30.850
will take this point and merge it together at the center and this point.

09:31.250 --> 09:35.930
No this point here and merge it at the center.

09:35.940 --> 09:40.690
Then I'm left with these trying to figure out what to do with these.

09:40.770 --> 09:42.980
For now we could try just this.

09:43.020 --> 09:45.510
Go ahead and connect them up here.

09:45.510 --> 09:48.550
This may be something that I revisit.

09:49.230 --> 09:51.880
We'll see how this works.

09:52.050 --> 10:00.500
Now for the eyes what I'll probably do is go and re create these particular eyes.

10:00.540 --> 10:03.390
These eyes are pretty high poly If I recall.

10:03.600 --> 10:09.600
So I'll take these two and I'll go ahead and duplicate them with shifty and then I'm going to move them

10:09.600 --> 10:12.600
over with the key to the third layer.

10:12.900 --> 10:15.090
And let's see how that works.

10:15.090 --> 10:22.380
So now I've got those eyes over here and I've still got to create the little Buckel pieces that go on

10:22.380 --> 10:24.630
the front of the strap and the belt.

10:24.630 --> 10:34.320
But generally speaking we have gone from over seven million trials to under ten thousand trials.

10:34.350 --> 10:35.240
That's not bad.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.740
That's the kind of thing we want.

10:37.740 --> 10:44.850
So in the next part of this series we're going to begin working on U-V mapping the low poly character

10:44.850 --> 10:52.790
here and it's onto those U-V maps that we will then make our normal maps from the high resolution sculped.

10:52.830 --> 10:55.240
So stay tuned for all of that.
