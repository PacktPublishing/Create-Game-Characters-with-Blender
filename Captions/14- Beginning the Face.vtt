00:00.570 --> 00:04.230
I thought today I'd start working on the face on the head.

00:04.230 --> 00:09.960
I've already started pulling the eyes down so they're in line with the eyes of the character to take

00:09.960 --> 00:11.730
a look at the mouth here.

00:11.790 --> 00:19.770
Let me go over to the character images view and I'm going to press the three key here and if I hit the

00:19.770 --> 00:23.310
Z key you can see the wire frame.

00:23.310 --> 00:31.640
I've got optimal display turned on so I can see the original edges of the model.

00:31.680 --> 00:38.970
We turn that off of course it will look very dense but I've already started pulling the eyes in or pulling

00:38.970 --> 00:42.950
the eyes down you can see the eye loops here.

00:42.990 --> 00:45.600
I've already begun pulling those down.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.500
Let's take a look at the mouth and nose here.

00:48.540 --> 00:54.550
I'm going to go to my sculped mode here and get that grab brush.

00:54.550 --> 00:58.640
I think I'm just going to take the mouth here and move it down just a hair.

00:58.800 --> 01:04.710
So it's more in line with the mouth on the character as well as the nose here too.

01:04.740 --> 01:05.860
Something like that.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.990
It doesn't need to be perfect.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.870
I just want to get it down here in the general area.

01:12.110 --> 01:18.950
So the head is pretty small compared to the reference images and that's fine.

01:18.950 --> 01:23.260
We're going to begin pulling those up or sculpting out I should say.

01:23.570 --> 01:23.850
All right.

01:23.870 --> 01:28.530
Let's go back to our default view and take a look at that.

01:28.610 --> 01:34.660
So that is generally where the mouth and the eyes and the nose will be placed.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.390
But there's going to be a lot more volume to the head both on the sides and on the top.

01:41.720 --> 01:45.970
Let's start just getting the head in the basic shape that we needed.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.130
Creating the basic surfaces and planes.

01:49.520 --> 01:54.330
I think what I want to do is first of all begin smoothing this out.

01:54.350 --> 01:55.750
Actually I'm going to go to the pinch.

01:55.760 --> 02:02.240
I mean I know I'm going to need that and then I can smooth by just pressing the shift key and I want

02:02.240 --> 02:04.690
to begin smoothing this out.

02:05.330 --> 02:09.570
So if I hold that shift key down I can smooth it back.

02:10.670 --> 02:19.120
And what I want to do is start creating the plains of the front of the head and the sides.

02:19.190 --> 02:28.720
I want this to be kind of flat up front and I want to build up a bit of the volume up top as well and

02:28.730 --> 02:33.270
I'll use my clay strips to do that.

02:33.310 --> 02:37.790
So I'm just going to try and build the basic shape of the head

02:40.800 --> 02:44.760
and I'll go ahead and start building up the ears as well here.

02:46.720 --> 02:54.740
Giving this a little bit more bulk I may have to use the grab brush as well but let me see what I can

02:54.740 --> 02:56.320
do with the clay strips here.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.000
I'll try the inflate on the ears.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.510
I'm having a hard time getting the clay strips to work.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.030
I'll just try the inflate

03:10.880 --> 03:13.000
seems to be working a little bit better.

03:16.620 --> 03:17.130
All right.

03:17.130 --> 03:21.560
So I think using the inflate helped a bit with that

03:28.380 --> 03:30.790
and I'll pull these out just a little bit.

03:34.500 --> 03:42.200
All right so we're still very much in jest roughing things in here.

03:42.280 --> 03:48.490
I want to press the control button and cut in just a bit on the ears just to give that little bit of

03:48.490 --> 03:54.350
indentation there to begin that see how that works.

03:57.490 --> 03:58.440
All right.

03:58.720 --> 04:04.540
And I want to just define kind of the planes of the head.

04:04.540 --> 04:10.060
There's really kind of an edge should come right around here and I'm going to see if I can define that

04:10.060 --> 04:16.290
a little bit better just by using the pinch tool coming down here.

04:18.370 --> 04:26.610
Like that maybe connecting to the top of the ears here and using the flattened brush to kind of flatten

04:26.610 --> 04:28.030
out the front of the head there.

04:28.170 --> 04:35.920
So I'm just trying to get a sense of the basic planes of the face here.

04:35.930 --> 04:36.340
All right.

04:36.350 --> 04:38.460
Let's take a look at this how we're doing.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.270
It's not too bad.

04:40.790 --> 04:42.680
I think that's about what I want.

04:44.070 --> 04:46.510
I think I'll try and build up the job.

04:46.560 --> 04:47.850
Just a hair here.

04:54.080 --> 05:01.440
And this muscle here looks like instead of going back so far it should come down behind the ear here.

05:01.930 --> 05:03.650
So I'll need to work on that.

05:05.100 --> 05:14.700
Realizing that and it looks like back here these muscles really need to come down a little bit more

05:15.690 --> 05:17.630
to the scapula.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.320
Like this.

05:21.610 --> 05:27.400
And for these muscles as well there's kind of a triangular shape that comes down like this.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.400
We can maybe fill that in a bit.

05:33.960 --> 05:34.490
All right.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.720
I think we've got that basic shape down.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.300
I'll go back to my default view here.

05:44.810 --> 05:52.220
And when I'm doing work kind of close up like this I feel like the default camera is a little too wide

05:52.220 --> 05:53.030
angle.

05:53.180 --> 05:59.390
So what I'll do sometimes is go to the properties panel here by pressing the N key and scroll down you

05:59.390 --> 06:01.840
can see this Lim's field in it.

06:01.910 --> 06:07.590
And it's at 35 millimeters and that's a fairly wide angle lens for this kind of work.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.610
So I'll change this to maybe like 45 or 50.

06:10.610 --> 06:13.600
Let me try 50 first here.

06:13.700 --> 06:22.660
And to me that gives a little bit more realistic view of the character when they're close up like this.

06:22.670 --> 06:23.340
All right.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.600
I think that's looking pretty good.

06:25.610 --> 06:31.340
What I want to do is go ahead and start cutting in the eyes and trying to figure out where the nose

06:31.370 --> 06:33.270
and the mouth are going to go.

06:33.410 --> 06:37.270
And all of this will be adjusted of course as we go.

06:37.820 --> 06:41.780
But I want to take a look at where the eyes should be.

06:41.780 --> 06:48.920
Let me go back real quick to the character images here and hit the Z key and I'm going to go ahead and

06:48.920 --> 06:52.010
use this sculpt to draw a brush.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.480
Well I want to do is cut in a bit.

06:54.590 --> 06:56.820
I'm going to tumble this around so I can see it.

06:56.990 --> 07:03.860
And I want to maybe reduce the breast size and hold the control key.

07:03.920 --> 07:11.670
I just want to cut in just a little bit here where the eyes are going to be let me try this.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.250
You go not too much

07:16.850 --> 07:20.790
just enough to get an eyeball in there when we need to.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.800
There we go something like this.

07:24.880 --> 07:32.680
I'll smooth that a bit with the shift key and also cut the end with the Control key.

07:33.290 --> 07:36.530
All right so there's the basics.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.140
The basis of the eyes here.

07:39.810 --> 07:42.300
Let me rough in the nose real quick.

07:42.300 --> 07:51.240
Just let me I'll continue with the sculpt draw reduced the strength quite a bit and let me just try

07:51.240 --> 07:53.770
and get a nose hint in here.

07:55.390 --> 07:57.090
Something like this.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.150
OK.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.670
And then let's work on the mouth.

08:01.670 --> 08:05.960
Let's get to some sort of feature for the mouth here.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.700
Now for the mouth I think.

08:09.140 --> 08:16.530
Let me try and tug the edges of the mouth here out just a hair with the crab brush.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.710
Don't need to do too much there.

08:21.420 --> 08:28.300
And then I think I'm going to come back now that I know kind of where this should be.

08:28.430 --> 08:29.560
I can see that here.

08:29.570 --> 08:34.360
Now I'm going to go back to the default view here.

08:35.370 --> 08:36.540
And let's

08:40.080 --> 08:45.330
then use the scope to draw pretty small.

08:45.420 --> 08:52.580
Let's try this and I'm going to cut in see if I can create a mouth area here.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.460
Something like that.

09:11.860 --> 09:18.070
And then I'm going to begin taking this and pulling it closed to let me just get a little bit more in

09:18.070 --> 09:18.840
here.

09:22.200 --> 09:29.310
I'm just using the Control key to cut in here and I just want a bit of an area that I can then close

09:29.310 --> 09:31.400
down.

09:31.440 --> 09:42.410
Let's try this come back to the grab opened another bit and let's begin geste closing this up a bit.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.510
Let's go ahead and mask an area out.

09:59.550 --> 10:02.510
I'm going to mask off the top real quick.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.340
Mask this area

10:14.150 --> 10:15.980
like that.

10:16.150 --> 10:19.020
You can come down like that a bit.

10:19.100 --> 10:26.050
And now if I go back to the grab brush I can a little more effectively move these up

10:31.580 --> 10:35.810
so and then

10:38.700 --> 10:45.380
maybe I'll invert the mask with control I maybe pull these down a bit too.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.470
So they come down over it just a hair

10:51.100 --> 10:51.970
something like that.

10:51.970 --> 10:55.590
So we have kind of some geometry to begin the lips here.

10:55.930 --> 10:59.760
And then I'll clear the mask with him.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.000
All right.

11:01.270 --> 11:06.890
So we have the beginnings now of our face to move forward though.

11:06.910 --> 11:12.190
I think what I also want to do is bring in an image of my character here.

11:12.220 --> 11:18.740
In this view over here what I like to do sometimes is to grab this corner here and just drag it down.

11:19.060 --> 11:27.900
And then change this window here to the image editor which is here.

11:28.610 --> 11:38.450
And then I can open up one of my images in here so I'll click on open and I'll open up the front view

11:38.450 --> 11:39.130
here.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.160
Like open.

11:41.740 --> 11:48.550
And there he is in an image over here so now I have kind of a reference of what I'm doing here.

11:48.580 --> 11:52.150
Now I could also split this up again if I wanted.

11:52.810 --> 11:54.560
Sometimes you can do this.

11:54.580 --> 11:55.510
I can move this up.

11:55.510 --> 11:58.240
I don't really need that right there for now.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.990
I can split this up again.

12:00.900 --> 12:04.510
And bring in a side view here.

12:04.940 --> 12:11.500
I'm in the middle mouse button click and drag on this bar and slide it over and then open and click

12:11.500 --> 12:13.560
on the side view.

12:13.870 --> 12:21.400
And now I've got my front end side view images here as I sculpt in here so I can kind of get a sense

12:21.400 --> 12:24.040
of what I should be doing here.

12:24.100 --> 12:30.250
Now before I begin doing anything else what I really need is some eyeballs to put in here to kind of

12:31.150 --> 12:37.350
act as landmarks for the rest of the forehead eyes nose etc..

12:37.480 --> 12:41.490
It's just good to have those eyes in there as you sculpt.

12:41.560 --> 12:47.650
So in the next video what we'll do is we'll go ahead and model and eyeball to put in there as kind of

12:47.830 --> 12:52.020
a landmark structure so we can begin sculpting the rest of the head.
