00:00.680 --> 00:05.820
In this part of the series I'm going to try and rig the character in the last series.

00:05.840 --> 00:13.340
I did it all manually because I think it's great to know how to rig manually before you start using

00:13.340 --> 00:17.070
any automated tools the automated tools are fantastic.

00:17.120 --> 00:22.760
If they work perfectly but if they don't then how do you go back and fix anything.

00:22.760 --> 00:30.080
So you need to kind of know the fundamentals before you can actually troubleshoot anything on an automated

00:30.170 --> 00:31.400
rigging system.

00:31.400 --> 00:36.970
So for this character I think what I'd like to do is use the rigor Phi add on.

00:37.550 --> 00:39.260
It's been a while since I've used it.

00:39.260 --> 00:43.720
There have been a few updates since then so I thought I'd take a look at it.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.770
The first thing you may need to do is add the add on install the add on.

00:48.770 --> 00:51.660
So let's go over here to file user preferences.

00:51.890 --> 01:00.650
And in this window let's click on the add ons button and I'm going to type in rigor Phi.

01:00.780 --> 01:01.850
There it is.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.600
You should come up with this entry here.

01:03.620 --> 01:10.430
Now mine has already checked but if yours isn't you just need to add a checkmark here and then click

01:10.430 --> 01:15.160
save user settings and then we should be good to go.

01:16.180 --> 01:25.750
So before we add the rig by rig into the scene let's make sure that the character is is prepared for

01:25.750 --> 01:27.090
rigging.

01:27.160 --> 01:32.080
I'm going to hit the key and let's go take a look at the transforms here.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.420
It turns out that my transforms look pretty good.

01:34.420 --> 01:40.300
I've got zeroes in location zeros in rotation and ones in scale and that's pretty good.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.610
My guess is that he's going to be too big.

01:42.610 --> 01:45.940
This is about 25 meters tall here.

01:45.970 --> 01:51.490
So when the rig of five rig comes in it's going to be a lot smaller and that's fine we can shrink him

01:51.490 --> 01:52.220
down.

01:52.360 --> 01:58.420
If your transforms aren't zeros and ones over here you can always select the character and press control

01:58.480 --> 02:06.160
a and apply the location and then press controls again and apply the rotation and scale and that will

02:06.160 --> 02:09.580
get all of these back to their zeros and ones.

02:09.580 --> 02:15.460
Now let me take a look in the eyes here I've got eyes separate from the head or the main body so it

02:15.460 --> 02:18.850
looks like that's all zeros and ones that's all zeros and ones.

02:18.850 --> 02:21.360
OK so it looks like that's pretty good.

02:21.370 --> 02:23.920
All right so let's go ahead and create the Omniture.

02:23.920 --> 02:30.490
If I come over here to the Create tab and I scroll down and I click armature all I'm going to get is

02:30.490 --> 02:31.930
a single bone.

02:31.930 --> 02:40.150
So if I click this you can see if I zoom in way down here I'll hit the period key on the numpad And

02:40.150 --> 02:42.400
if we zoom in all we get is just one ball.

02:42.430 --> 02:48.430
And that's certainly the way you want to be in when you're doing it manually but that's not going to

02:48.430 --> 02:49.180
help us a whole lot.

02:49.180 --> 02:52.960
So I'm going to undo this with a control or command Z.

02:53.290 --> 02:58.740
What we need to do instead of using the Create tab is use Shift A.

02:58.750 --> 03:03.790
So to add the rig I'll press shift A and I'll choose armature.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.840
And here's that single bone Here's the rigger fi rig and here's the new pitch you poi rig.

03:11.890 --> 03:21.340
Now I haven't used this yet I think it was added as an option in version 2.7 for I believe and it includes

03:22.000 --> 03:31.180
facial rig as well but we don't need that because this character really wasn't set up to open a mouth

03:31.180 --> 03:33.050
or blink or anything.

03:33.130 --> 03:37.090
So I'm just going to go ahead and use the rig a FI add on.

03:37.150 --> 03:42.130
So our click human Metta rig and there we go.

03:42.330 --> 03:44.150
And you notice that.

03:44.190 --> 03:47.360
Yes sure enough the rig is really tiny.

03:47.370 --> 03:49.050
So it's way down here.

03:49.050 --> 03:56.840
So this is actually more reasonably sized in terms of real world scale.

03:56.910 --> 04:05.220
The Blendr units are really pretty much meter's if we come over here to I believe the world know about

04:05.220 --> 04:06.390
the scene here.

04:06.390 --> 04:12.600
There we go if we come over to the scene you can see that in the unit's field we've got metric units

04:12.660 --> 04:15.260
and imperial or inches and feet.

04:15.270 --> 04:22.560
So if we go from the Blendr units here to metric you can see that nothing really changes it's just 1.9

04:22.640 --> 04:23.360
meters.

04:23.400 --> 04:29.190
If we change to imperial then the grid gets a little smaller.

04:29.250 --> 04:35.870
Things change a little bit but the difference between metres and Blendr units is pretty much nothing.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.660
So this is probably a good size to make our character.

04:39.930 --> 04:42.910
If we're going to take it into a game engine.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.350
All right.

04:43.350 --> 04:48.710
So what I'm going to do now is scale my character down to fit that rig.

04:48.710 --> 04:55.650
I'm going to go and select low poly character as well as the eyes and I'm to change the center of pivot

04:55.650 --> 04:58.210
from the median point to the 3D cursor.

04:58.590 --> 05:04.830
And just to make sure we're scaling from that point down there at the center of the grid and I'll just

05:04.830 --> 05:09.520
scale everything down until I get it about the right size.

05:09.540 --> 05:16.330
So let me come to wireframe with a Z key and let me scale down a little bit more.

05:18.010 --> 05:20.810
Something like that.

05:20.830 --> 05:30.010
Now if I select the rig and come over to the object display I can turn on x ray here and see it through

05:30.310 --> 05:31.960
through the character.

05:31.960 --> 05:38.860
Now I'll hit the three key and the five key to go to orthographic view and I'll take this character

05:39.250 --> 05:41.700
as well as the eyes.

05:43.270 --> 05:50.070
I'll switch back to medium point and I'll drag the character forward just a little bit something like

05:51.710 --> 05:53.050
something like that.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.870
I think that'll work.

05:55.920 --> 06:04.450
Now once we've got once I've moved this character I'm going to have to now re-establish the center but

06:04.460 --> 06:11.610
I think moving this forward just a little bit will save me some headache in setting up the rig.

06:11.610 --> 06:17.810
Just trying to center up the hips and the neck along the side of the character here.

06:18.780 --> 06:20.600
And that looks pretty good.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.040
All right.

06:21.050 --> 06:28.880
So if I select the character now I need to move this back into the center of the grid move this origin

06:28.880 --> 06:30.720
point back to the center.

06:30.770 --> 06:38.120
So I'll just go to tools and set origin and I'll say origin to 3D cursor and that'll pop that back into

06:38.120 --> 06:42.460
the center and I'll do the same with the eyes.

06:42.560 --> 06:47.810
I'll select these and put those into the center as well.

06:48.890 --> 06:56.540
Now we need to make sure that our scale and our rotation and our location are all zeroed out.

06:56.570 --> 07:02.250
So we've got zeros in the location and the rotation but not in the scale so unimpressed actually I'll

07:02.270 --> 07:12.310
select all of these here and I'll press control a and let's apply the scale there we go that's what

07:12.310 --> 07:13.360
we want.

07:13.360 --> 07:21.100
So now if I select the character you can see that is 1.9 meters tall the transformations are all zeros

07:21.100 --> 07:23.210
and ones and that's good.

07:23.230 --> 07:31.330
All right so the next thing we need to do is get these joints in place so I'll select the rig go to

07:31.330 --> 07:37.800
the front view here and it looks like I've still got my image there and look how big it is.

07:37.990 --> 07:43.500
Let me scroll down and turn off or get rid of this image.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.660
Here we go.

07:45.740 --> 07:48.810
You don't need that.

07:49.150 --> 07:55.060
All right so now that we've got the general shape or the general proportion of the character correct.

07:55.060 --> 08:02.110
Let's go ahead and tab into edit mode for the rig here and what we need to do is come over here to the

08:02.110 --> 08:05.500
options tab and turn on X mirror.

08:05.770 --> 08:13.210
And what that'll do is that will allow us to move these joints around and have the other side come along.

08:13.210 --> 08:18.370
So now what we need to do is actually just move these around and tell them in the proper place.

08:18.370 --> 08:23.140
Now this is going to take a little time not too bad though.

08:23.140 --> 08:31.660
I'm going to go ahead and start moving these back like this and if I go into wireframe and I'm going

08:31.660 --> 08:39.630
to press the control key and click and drag I can select all of these joints and move them back a bit.

08:42.490 --> 08:46.000
I'll select this and move it up to where the ankle should be.

08:47.410 --> 08:57.060
And maybe these here and move those forward where the toes should be someone's going to move this up

08:57.060 --> 08:59.250
to about the ball of the toe.

08:59.520 --> 09:05.840
And then on and move this toe forward all the way like this.

09:06.030 --> 09:07.990
I need to know where that edge is.

09:07.990 --> 09:12.600
So what I'm going to do is go back to object mode and select the character and I'm going to come over

09:12.600 --> 09:20.430
here to the object panel and turn on wires so that I can see where the edges are.

09:20.590 --> 09:29.680
So now if I go back to the rig I can begin lining up these joints where the edges are that I want things

09:29.680 --> 09:36.090
to bend that so I want this foot to bend at that edge so I'm going to put that joint right there.

09:36.100 --> 09:39.670
Same thing applies here for this joint.

09:39.670 --> 09:45.190
I need to figure out where the knees going to bend and it looks like it's going to bend at this joint

09:45.520 --> 09:47.010
so I'll put it right there.

09:47.820 --> 09:53.260
Now also notice there's a bit of a bend in the leg here.

09:53.280 --> 10:02.040
When we turn on I.K. inverse kinematics that will allow us to grab one control at the foot here and

10:02.040 --> 10:04.350
move the whole leg around.

10:04.350 --> 10:12.270
And it needs to know which way the default bend is going to be if we put this chain exactly straight.

10:12.270 --> 10:18.240
It's going to be a 50 50 chance as to which way the computer is going to bend the leg and if it bends

10:18.240 --> 10:20.390
it backwards it's going to be painful.

10:20.550 --> 10:28.200
So we want to put a bit of a bend in that joint to make sure that Blendr knows which way we want it

10:28.200 --> 10:30.040
to bend.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.430
All right I'm going to get this right here.

10:33.950 --> 10:40.570
Come up to the front now and make sure everything's in place here once again I'll hit the Z key to go

10:40.570 --> 10:49.240
into wireframe and I'll control click and drag this and just drag all these over so they're lined up

10:49.240 --> 10:52.170
with the foot and we go.

10:52.810 --> 10:53.980
Let's think about this.

10:53.980 --> 10:56.550
Are these hips in the proper place.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.730
They don't seem to be.

10:57.730 --> 11:07.540
It seems to me like this whole bone can come down to bout where the waist is and it seems like these

11:07.540 --> 11:09.590
should be able to come down as well.

11:11.310 --> 11:19.990
Down to where the hip would be the hip joint to the leg that feels like it's a little bit better.

11:21.550 --> 11:22.190
All right.

11:22.220 --> 11:25.290
So how about this joint.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.120
Where is it.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.190
It's lining up along this edge here.

11:28.190 --> 11:29.210
That's not bad.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.790
I like that.

11:30.830 --> 11:39.740
Now for the arms it looks like I could grab this whole chain here like so and maybe bring this whole

11:39.740 --> 11:43.580
thing down to kind of where that shoulder joint would be.

11:43.660 --> 11:50.630
And I could maybe rotated a hair and bring that down like this.

11:50.630 --> 11:55.220
I'm just trying to place that shoulder joint right in there.

11:55.290 --> 11:59.360
Now if I'd select these I can move these down a bit.

11:59.550 --> 12:05.620
I'll see if I can grab these bones here and start moving them into the hand.

12:05.640 --> 12:12.480
This is probably the most tedious part is getting all the hand joints in place or all the finger joints

12:12.510 --> 12:13.440
in place.

12:14.570 --> 12:20.660
I'm just trying to get this joint right on the edge right here at the wrist.

12:20.780 --> 12:27.100
I think what I'm going to do is try and select these bones here and maybe scale them up just a hair.

12:27.260 --> 12:28.550
So they're a little bit bigger.

12:29.930 --> 12:35.480
So they fit into the hand a little bit better maybe a little bit more something like that.

12:35.570 --> 12:36.320
There we go.

12:36.530 --> 12:43.550
So now I've got to go through and align each of these joints up with the fingers and it takes a while

12:43.550 --> 12:46.980
so I'll do that off camera here.

12:47.030 --> 12:54.050
So what we'll do in the next video is once all the joints are in place will go back to object mode and

12:54.050 --> 13:02.030
come over here to the armature panel and we're going to click generate down here in the rig 5 panel

13:02.390 --> 13:03.790
and we'll see how it works.
