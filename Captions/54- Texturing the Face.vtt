00:00.930 --> 00:05.750
Today let's take a look at texture painting the face of the character.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.450
Now here's a funny story.

00:08.760 --> 00:13.580
After I stopped recording yesterday the phone rang and I got pulled away.

00:13.590 --> 00:20.180
And then when I finally came back to the computer I just saved Blendr and closed it.

00:20.250 --> 00:21.760
And what do you think happened.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.900
I lost all of that paint information I did on the torso.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.410
You'd think I'd know by now.

00:28.410 --> 00:38.950
So what I did is I went back and read did that for the torso and also did the legs and the fingers.

00:39.720 --> 00:43.850
So just learn from my mistake.

00:44.050 --> 00:52.700
Save BUSCHER and save your image with alt s when you are doing texture painting and in Blender.

00:52.710 --> 00:58.690
Now I had mentioned Gomorrha from Guardians Of The Galaxy some time ago and here she is.

00:58.690 --> 01:03.060
I figured I might as well use some of this skin tone.

01:03.060 --> 01:07.860
Some of these colors if I can for the face of our character here.

01:08.220 --> 01:12.180
What's interesting is this is actually not her.

01:12.240 --> 01:22.400
This is an image of a one sixteenth scale model from hot toys a figurine of her.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.090
They did an amazing job.

01:24.090 --> 01:32.970
Now I would prefer to use an image of her from real life but all the images I could find from the movie

01:33.750 --> 01:40.700
were in very light blue light or red light or very contrast.

01:40.750 --> 01:48.160
It was really difficult to find just kind of a standard lighting situation in that movie.

01:48.210 --> 01:51.470
I try and use real world reference when I can.

01:51.750 --> 01:55.240
But this particular instance I just couldn't find anything.

01:55.290 --> 01:56.520
So let's give this a try.

01:56.520 --> 02:01.500
Let's zoom in here to the character's face and let's see if we can do.

02:01.830 --> 02:11.870
So the face on the U.V. map is over here on mine so we can keep an eye on that as we go here.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.950
Now this particular image I think has some Browns in here.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.310
And that's what I've been doing to some Browns around here.

02:20.490 --> 02:23.920
So we'll try and do that as well.

02:23.940 --> 02:28.890
I'll make sure I'm on the skin texture paint slot and I'll go back over the Tools tab.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.440
And this is the palette.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.150
The color palette.

02:33.150 --> 02:39.000
I've been using for the skin here and it's got some good greens and browns here that we sampled off

02:39.000 --> 02:41.080
the image of the Guana.

02:41.160 --> 02:47.280
So we'll continue to use some of these maybe adding some from this image but really this is more for

02:47.280 --> 02:53.660
me just to look at and get a sense of what's happening on the face.

02:53.770 --> 03:01.120
So let's start I'm going to start here with that darker shadow color that I've been using and I'm not

03:01.120 --> 03:03.370
sure let's just see what it looks like.

03:03.370 --> 03:05.380
OK I've got that.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.120
I will also go ahead and turn on symmetry.

03:08.120 --> 03:17.020
We might as well do that and I'll come in here and start with some of the darker areas like maybe underneath

03:17.050 --> 03:23.260
the mouth underneath the nose up in the eye sockets here.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.920
So let's see what we can do with that.

03:26.050 --> 03:33.520
So I'll bring the strength back down and the jitter and spacing is pretty low so I think I'll leave

03:33.520 --> 03:34.500
it there.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.150
And let's just see what we can do.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.290
Let's do a few tests and see what happens here.

03:44.590 --> 03:51.570
For this at least right now let me try it with the texture off and see what happens here.

03:59.220 --> 04:05.910
I will also press alt F on the center of the character's face so we center up around that.

04:05.910 --> 04:10.780
And now I can tumble around that point that helps.

04:11.030 --> 04:19.430
And in addition I'm going to go ahead and turn on face masking and with the L key select the head and

04:19.430 --> 04:21.380
I'll go ahead and select the ears as well.

04:25.340 --> 04:31.760
Maybe I will go ahead and select the body as well just in case anything moves down into there.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.480
All right so now let's try this.

04:36.550 --> 04:39.910
I just didn't want to accidentally pain on the eyeball here

04:42.780 --> 04:51.460
and I think I'll also use this darker color to try and delineate the lines coming down from the nose.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.250
See what I can do here.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.020
And also around that edge of the nose back in here.

05:07.190 --> 05:14.840
And even some of this shadow underneath the cheekbones I think maybe we could try that.

05:14.840 --> 05:21.200
If I can get it placed in the right place here let me make sure that the specular is on for both of

05:21.200 --> 05:26.340
my lights and they are to see if it helps if I turn one off.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.280
Now doesn't help much.

05:32.970 --> 05:37.360
Well let me try it like this and see what I can do with this.

05:37.390 --> 05:43.380
You can see the texture a little better so what's going on here now is I've got the specular turned

05:43.380 --> 05:48.660
off for the front light but turned on for the back light.

05:48.660 --> 05:54.630
So let me just try it like this for a few minutes and see if this helps at all so I can just see the

05:55.170 --> 05:57.040
textures a little better.

06:00.850 --> 06:09.660
I'm going also put some shadow in the ears up here and maybe some down beneath the ear where it contacts

06:10.800 --> 06:15.970
connects with the head maybe even down underneath there.

06:20.650 --> 06:30.580
You can put a little shadow at the base of the skull right back here and maybe even just a touch right

06:30.580 --> 06:31.750
between the eyes here.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.790
I'm looking at this right here.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.220
You see how that works.

06:37.420 --> 06:43.030
And then I'll come back in with some highlights on the other on either side at the Browns.

06:43.030 --> 06:46.440
We'll see if that works at all.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.530
All right.

06:47.530 --> 06:52.870
So we've got some basic shadows laid down.

06:52.870 --> 06:57.140
I should also probably do that down here as well underneath the neck.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.760
Let me try that.

07:01.490 --> 07:02.450
OK.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.010
Let's take a look at this.

07:04.020 --> 07:07.710
Now let's come in and work on some of the highlights.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.400
Well let me see over here.

07:09.410 --> 07:14.550
I'm going to select I'm going to press the key and see what kind of colors I can find over here.

07:14.570 --> 07:15.580
This is kind of nice.

07:15.590 --> 07:21.550
And we try that this looks a little bit more like what I'm looking for now with this.

07:21.560 --> 07:26.880
I think I want to go ahead and turn that texture back on me grab that texture.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.350
And we've got it on random brush mapping.

07:33.350 --> 07:41.870
Let me just turn up the jet or just a little bit turn up the spacing a hair like that.

07:41.910 --> 07:43.650
Let's try that.

07:43.650 --> 07:51.130
So we get a little bit of texture in the highlights and let's just test this and see something like

07:51.130 --> 07:53.350
that may be a little much.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.450
Let's back that off a hair.

07:55.870 --> 07:56.650
Let's try that

08:00.560 --> 08:01.990
something like that.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.430
Yeah OK.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.310
A little bit more on the tip of the nose there.

08:06.470 --> 08:16.050
We've got some pretty strong highlights here into the I am going to try and replicate that like that.

08:17.270 --> 08:18.890
And along that cheekbone

08:21.680 --> 08:29.330
some interesting stuff going on above the eyes so I'll try that and way up here as well.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.260
I like that.

08:33.270 --> 08:38.500
Let's take a look at that little part under the nose.

08:38.670 --> 08:42.660
It looks like I could maybe just do this.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.120
Try that again.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.980
Something like that.

08:55.030 --> 09:07.930
We've got to highlight on the chin try and capture that and some highlights around here like this.

09:07.950 --> 09:10.980
Let's take a look at the lips.

09:11.190 --> 09:13.380
This is quite an interesting green.

09:13.380 --> 09:15.810
Here do I want that green on this.

09:15.810 --> 09:17.290
Let me try this one.

09:17.310 --> 09:23.800
I think this is a color that we got off at the eco wanna let me try this one here.

09:24.760 --> 09:29.930
And once again I will go ahead and keep the texture on here just to test this

09:34.800 --> 09:42.100
it looks like lipstick on let's try and widen that out.

09:44.190 --> 09:46.720
That may be too dark.

09:47.600 --> 09:47.930
Yeah.

09:47.930 --> 09:51.380
Let's try and let's go back right.

09:51.380 --> 09:55.810
So let's look for something that isn't quite as dark.

09:55.810 --> 09:57.180
How about this here.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.480
Let's try that.

10:03.310 --> 10:08.040
That may be a little bit better yeah that darker color really screamed.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.290
Lipstick.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.620
Let's try that.

10:14.660 --> 10:15.830
All right.

10:15.830 --> 10:21.830
Now what let's do is come back here with that lighter color and what I'm going to do is turn off the

10:21.830 --> 10:27.780
texture map and turn the spacing down looks like it's already there.

10:27.800 --> 10:33.030
And I'm going to come in here with a really fine brush and get some of that straight.

10:33.140 --> 10:33.800
There.

10:33.890 --> 10:38.590
See if that's at all possible and maybe Let's see

10:41.620 --> 10:43.150
bring the strength up here.

10:48.350 --> 10:49.710
Something like that.

10:52.140 --> 10:58.810
Let's turn that specular highlights back on over here for that front light.

11:00.740 --> 11:02.830
Let's take a look at that.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.100
Not too bad.

11:04.310 --> 11:10.480
I think what I need to do is go through and give it a little bit more of that texture that I was doing

11:11.360 --> 11:15.710
and maybe even some more of these highlights like from here.

11:15.710 --> 11:17.050
Let's try this.

11:17.090 --> 11:19.920
I'm going to put that texture back on.

11:20.050 --> 11:25.800
And when I just test this let me increase the strength.

11:25.810 --> 11:33.310
And what's pretty striking to see what happens here so I'm going to go through and maybe do a few highlights

11:33.310 --> 11:34.500
like this.

11:35.770 --> 11:40.370
I feel like that shadow underneath the cheek is a little strong.

11:40.520 --> 11:51.090
I'm going to flip the pen over and see if I can erase that back just a hair.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.160
So we're getting there.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.360
I think there's more I can do here.

11:54.420 --> 11:59.280
I may bring in the smear or soften brush.

11:59.280 --> 12:05.320
Let's just see if this does anything or it just destroys everything I've already done.

12:08.830 --> 12:11.680
And we go on I also just smeared that a bit.

12:11.750 --> 12:14.730
So I think there's more I can do.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.820
But I think that's getting there.

12:16.820 --> 12:20.450
I think it will blend in fairly well with the rest of the character.

12:20.450 --> 12:23.910
Let me turn off face masking here.

12:23.990 --> 12:30.500
There might be an opportunity to come in with more of the highlights that I used in here up on the face.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.130
But I think that's a good start.

12:32.330 --> 12:38.720
Oh and also let me come over here and press alt s and I'm going to save this image and I'm also going

12:38.720 --> 12:48.740
to press control or command ass to save the scene and make sure that all of our images do not have an

12:48.740 --> 12:56.280
asterix here and that they've all been saved so you can see kind of where we've come from since the

12:56.280 --> 12:57.270
beginning here.

12:57.570 --> 13:08.710
The base color of the character and then we worked on our details for the straps and the tunic here.

13:08.730 --> 13:16.960
We did a little bit more with the straps for the for the boots and the gloves.

13:17.340 --> 13:21.860
And then we worked on our skin here.

13:21.990 --> 13:30.140
So I think the next thing we should work on is baking out all of these texture paint slots.

13:30.150 --> 13:33.720
All of these layers out to a single image.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.270
Now I do need to work on the eyes.

13:37.320 --> 13:43.800
I think the eyes are going to need to be their own objects so that we can have a map specifically for

13:43.800 --> 13:51.270
them because I think the U-V islands for the eyes here on this map are going to be too small and the

13:51.270 --> 13:54.990
pupils stand a very good chance of being pixilated and blurry.

13:54.990 --> 14:01.230
So maybe in the next one we'll split the eyes out and bring in a texture for the pupils.

14:01.320 --> 14:08.100
But then after that I think we'll be ready to bake out our color map and then we can go and test that

14:08.100 --> 14:12.840
out with our normal map and our ambient occlusion map in unity.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.010
So those are hopefully coming up next.
