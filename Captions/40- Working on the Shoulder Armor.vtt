WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:04.360
Well let's continue with our U-V mapping here.

00:04.420 --> 00:09.310
I think the next thing I'd like to work on is this little tunic thing.

00:09.310 --> 00:16.810
So I'm going to tab into edit mode and I'll just hover over the little tunic and press the L key and

00:16.810 --> 00:22.250
that will select all the linked components of that particular piece of the object.

00:22.600 --> 00:27.360
I'm going to press shift H and isolate it and let me just take a look at this.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.430
Let's think about how we'd want to do this.

00:30.470 --> 00:36.640
Well since the belt is going to be a different object or a different texture on the object I should

00:36.640 --> 00:37.280
say.

00:37.420 --> 00:45.460
I think we probably want to go ahead and assign a seam to this edge all the way around.

00:45.460 --> 00:52.090
So I'm going to just press alt and click and then shift alt and click and select that edge all the way

00:52.090 --> 00:53.120
around.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.500
Just want to hit Z to see it.

00:55.660 --> 01:06.750
There we go and I'll press Z to get out of wireframe and I'll then go to Control E. and Mark seem all

01:06.750 --> 01:06.950
right.

01:06.950 --> 01:13.340
So that will break the belt part off from the little tunic thing.

01:13.380 --> 01:20.660
The next thing I want to do is I think I want to break out these pieces here the front and the back.

01:20.660 --> 01:25.590
I'm going to select this edge up here and then I'm going to control click this edge right down here

01:25.590 --> 01:30.760
and that'll select all the edges in between those two.

01:30.870 --> 01:32.840
Actually I think I want to go this way.

01:32.840 --> 01:44.460
I think I'll go this way and then come down around here and then I'll select this hedge and see if I

01:44.460 --> 01:50.310
can control click this edge and that should select that all the way up there.

01:50.430 --> 01:57.900
All right so let's break them piece off control easy mark seam and let's do the same thing for the back.

01:57.900 --> 02:06.580
I'll select this control select this and then I'll have to kind of piecemeal select these edges on around.

02:06.930 --> 02:11.120
OK now let's control e Markstein with that.

02:11.250 --> 02:15.230
Now we've got this piece to think about.

02:15.230 --> 02:18.990
I think it's going to be broken off into two pieces.

02:18.990 --> 02:31.890
Let's go ahead and select this edge on around here and Marcus seem to break out this bottom part control

02:31.980 --> 02:35.940
the mark seems so let's think about this.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.430
Is that going to do what we want.

02:37.430 --> 02:41.830
We're going to break out this bottom we've got a seam all the way around.

02:41.940 --> 02:48.030
We're going to break out these panels the front and the back and we're going to break out the side panels

02:48.030 --> 02:52.160
here and here as well as the belt.

02:52.160 --> 02:52.540
All right.

02:52.550 --> 02:53.450
Let's give it a try.

02:53.450 --> 02:59.030
I'm going to switch from my default screen layout over to the editing.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.260
And here we go.

03:00.260 --> 03:05.550
I'll select everything with the key press you and unwrap OK.

03:05.550 --> 03:06.910
Not too bad actually.

03:06.930 --> 03:11.130
I'm going to switch from conformal to angle Base see if we get any thing better.

03:11.130 --> 03:16.560
Yeah I like Angle baste better because this is more circular but what part is this.

03:16.560 --> 03:23.740
I think this is the belt right here that's giving us a little bit of stretching what we could do is

03:23.740 --> 03:25.240
split the belt out.

03:25.300 --> 03:31.000
We could try giving it a seam actually instead of giving it a seam in the back.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.440
Let's give it a seam in the front where the belt buckle is.

03:35.590 --> 03:39.020
And that belt buckle will help hide the seam.

03:39.080 --> 03:46.120
I'll hit a to select all you and unwrap and we go that opens it up some.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.190
Well let's take a look at it with the texture on it.

03:50.290 --> 03:59.420
I come over here to the viewport shading and select texture and there is our test pattern.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.530
It's not bad.

04:01.470 --> 04:03.870
We've got some stretching down here.

04:05.380 --> 04:10.050
We of course have that seam there and we've got some stretching down here.

04:10.130 --> 04:14.750
So is there anything we can do to alleviate the stretching down here.

04:15.360 --> 04:15.950
Oh no.

04:15.950 --> 04:25.820
How about if we select this visage here and add a seam right down here to just break it apart down here

04:25.820 --> 04:30.430
at the bottom we shouldn't be seeing this seemed too much down here.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.390
So let's do this.

04:32.980 --> 04:36.250
I'm going to hit the A key press you and unwrap

04:39.080 --> 04:40.400
doesn't really help us much.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.900
Look at that.

04:41.970 --> 04:43.050
All right.

04:43.410 --> 04:46.840
How about these edges here let's try this

04:50.740 --> 04:55.630
and work these seams and see if that helps us at all with that pulling.

04:55.860 --> 05:00.050
Well go ahead and test that yeah.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.450
That helped.

05:01.450 --> 05:02.300
Look at that.

05:02.330 --> 05:10.880
So adding a couple of seams down here to break that apart at the bottom really helps smooth out that

05:10.880 --> 05:13.580
stretching here on the front panel.

05:13.910 --> 05:16.780
So I'll do the same thing back here now.

05:17.110 --> 05:27.600
I'll go ahead and select this edge and this edge and control the marks seem.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.990
Now let's try that.

05:30.370 --> 05:32.590
Oh yeah that looks a lot better.

05:32.590 --> 05:39.430
I like that a lot better than the last thing is do I really want to straighten this out.

05:39.460 --> 05:48.100
I could straighten the movies out here in the movie Ed. So that this texture flows more smoothly or

05:48.100 --> 05:51.780
more evenly along that belt.

05:51.820 --> 05:57.460
It would be easier to texture if I were to texture it in Photoshop or GIMP.

05:57.460 --> 05:59.680
If this was straight.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.050
So let's take a look at doing that.

06:02.230 --> 06:07.830
I'm going to press control up arrow to maximize this screen.

06:08.060 --> 06:11.790
Now let's come in here and take a look at this particular piece.

06:11.860 --> 06:14.830
I'm going to go to edge mode right down here.

06:15.930 --> 06:21.500
And I'll select this edge with alt click.

06:21.750 --> 06:28.320
And now you can see I've selected that whole edge along there along the bottom and to straighten this

06:28.320 --> 06:35.490
out to flatten it so it straight I can come down here to Uvas go to this weld a line and you've got

06:35.760 --> 06:43.950
straighten X and align X or Y Either way I'm going to try a line Y and let's see what happens.

06:45.230 --> 06:48.970
Yeah that's what I want to see how it's just made it nice and straight.

06:48.980 --> 06:55.250
Now I'm going to go through and do the same thing for all these others here press alt and click press

06:55.400 --> 07:03.650
w which is that shortcut for the world align menu and press align Y and that'll straighten that one

07:03.650 --> 07:04.700
out.

07:04.700 --> 07:14.810
I'll select the next one alt click w a line y alt click w align Y and just keep going here.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.560
All right so now we've got the horizontal edges straight.

07:18.560 --> 07:25.430
Now let's work on these vertical ones I'll just select each one of these w and this time I'll use a

07:25.430 --> 07:29.190
line X and that will just straighten those up.

07:31.820 --> 07:32.300
All right.

07:32.310 --> 07:38.670
So there they are this main part of the belt here is nice and blue and that's what we want.

07:38.670 --> 07:38.940
All right.

07:38.940 --> 07:42.120
Let's take a look at another part of the model in the press.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.650
All it takes to bring everything back.

07:44.850 --> 07:46.930
So we've got that piece done.

07:47.340 --> 07:50.030
Let's take a look at this shoulder piece.

07:50.100 --> 08:00.780
I think I'll need to break it out along here and press alt and click and I think I'm just going to have

08:00.780 --> 08:02.430
to follow this around

08:06.570 --> 08:09.220
the path of the armor here.

08:09.660 --> 08:17.880
So anywhere it meets with the skin of the character or the belt I'm going to go ahead and select an

08:17.880 --> 08:18.720
edge there.

08:22.460 --> 08:29.930
All right so now I have that edge selected all the way around I'll press control me and Mark seam and

08:29.930 --> 08:38.050
let's go take a look at this in the U-V editor come over here and go to the editing screen lay out and

08:38.110 --> 08:40.730
let's see what we can see here.

08:40.750 --> 08:46.540
I'm going to select this I'm going to hover over this and press the L key and then I'm going to change

08:46.540 --> 08:54.270
how I select linked from material back to seam and that we'll just select that piece.

08:54.570 --> 09:02.850
And now I think what I want to do is press shift H and that will hide everything except that one piece

09:02.880 --> 09:07.660
and I'm going to frame it up with the period key on the numpad.

09:07.710 --> 09:08.720
So here it is.

09:08.730 --> 09:14.040
I think what I'm going to do first is just press the key and unwrap and let's just see what we get.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.700
How ugly is it.

09:16.410 --> 09:18.660
Fairly ugly.

09:18.660 --> 09:26.130
There's some stretching up here that I don't like in here isn't too much of a concern for me because

09:26.130 --> 09:28.610
that's going to be near the neck of the character.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.230
You're not going to be able to see that very well.

09:31.230 --> 09:38.710
I think when I'd like to try is splitting off this vertical piece from the rest of the shoulder armor.

09:38.970 --> 09:42.900
I think maybe I can split this piece out completely right here.

09:42.900 --> 09:52.920
I just used Allt select to grab that whole edge and I'll press control me and Mark seam and then maybe

09:52.920 --> 10:00.290
I think I'll select this edge and this and come on around here and then we try and break this out.

10:00.290 --> 10:03.000
I'm not sure that this will work.

10:03.150 --> 10:06.640
It's good to try control easy mark see.

10:06.870 --> 10:12.600
So I'm thinking that I can break this piece out and that won't be too much of a problem because I've

10:13.020 --> 10:20.490
made I think the texture have seams or ridges along this area so I don't think that will be too much

10:20.490 --> 10:22.020
of a problem we'll see.

10:22.020 --> 10:26.410
I'll press the A key to select everything press you and unwrap.

10:26.580 --> 10:29.000
Yeah that breaks it out a little bit better.

10:29.160 --> 10:33.440
Breaks it down into multiple pieces.

10:33.690 --> 10:37.570
And I think that might be the way we have to do it.

10:38.040 --> 10:49.390
Let's go back to our default screen lay out I will press alt h to bring everything back and so far.

10:49.510 --> 10:55.740
Let's go to a viewport shading texture and so far here's what we have.

10:55.900 --> 11:04.520
We've got the shoulder armor the tunic the belt belt buckle the leg and the gauntlet.
