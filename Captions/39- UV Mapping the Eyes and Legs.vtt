WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:07.710
Let's continue on the U-V mapping for our character maybe we can work on the glove or Gauntlett.

00:08.130 --> 00:14.070
So now I'm going to come over here and I think I will break this apart again.

00:14.070 --> 00:23.650
I'll select this edge press control me and edge split and then I will hover over this press l and press

00:23.710 --> 00:24.120
shift.

00:24.130 --> 00:25.020
H.

00:25.510 --> 00:29.150
And now I can isolate this piece and work with it on its own.

00:29.900 --> 00:38.280
So I think what I will do is split this piece underneath here I'll just alt select this edge and let's

00:38.280 --> 00:41.880
see how this works before I try anything else I want to press control.

00:41.890 --> 00:50.690
Me and Mark seem and I'm going to select everything press you and unwrap not bad.

00:50.730 --> 00:55.840
I'm going to press control up arrow to expand this particular window.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.090
This isn't bad but we've got some polling here.

01:00.100 --> 01:08.230
I'd like to try and get rid of a pest control up there again to minimize that.

01:08.340 --> 01:13.550
I'm going to switch back to the texture view here and let me take a look at that.

01:13.560 --> 01:21.730
And you can see how the squares of the test pattern are a little bigger up here than they are down here.

01:21.780 --> 01:29.220
That may not be a problem but I think I'd like to see if I can get it a little bit closer in proportion

01:29.220 --> 01:30.050
here.

01:30.510 --> 01:32.820
So what I can do is maybe try this.

01:32.820 --> 01:43.310
I'm going to select this edge and see if I can split that thumb apart like that control the mark seam.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.170
Now if I select all and hit you and unwrap Let's see what happens.

01:48.810 --> 01:52.290
It's a little better we're not seeing as much stretching over here.

01:52.290 --> 01:57.300
Let me press control plus Yeah that's not bad.

01:57.330 --> 02:00.010
I think that might just work.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.770
Let's go back here.

02:01.840 --> 02:08.350
The difference in the squares between up here and down here is a little bit less.

02:08.350 --> 02:11.160
Still some different but not bad.

02:12.690 --> 02:18.080
And I think the seams that I've chosen here this seam underneath here and this seem right here.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.890
I think those will be fairly well hidden.

02:21.270 --> 02:21.660
All right.

02:21.660 --> 02:23.060
So let's go with that.

02:24.250 --> 02:25.750
Press alt H.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.750
Why don't we work on the eyes next.

02:29.960 --> 02:36.130
The eyes I've made is just very simple half spheres.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.570
So let me just select one here.

02:40.380 --> 02:50.600
When I go into edit mode and hover over one of these and press the L key and then I'll press shift h

02:50.600 --> 02:51.810
to isolate it.

02:52.160 --> 03:01.320
And as you can see it's just a half cylinder with an extrusion for the pupil and that's about it.

03:01.370 --> 03:09.470
Let's go into our U-V editing view and I'll frame that up with the period key on the numpad.

03:09.470 --> 03:17.780
If I come over here to the texture shading we can see that we can't see the checker pattern on it and

03:17.780 --> 03:21.220
that's because there are no U-V maps for this object.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.840
So let's just try this and see what happens.

03:23.840 --> 03:27.000
I'm going to press with everything selected here.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.550
I'm just going to press you and unwrap and let's just see what happens.

03:31.290 --> 03:36.950
All right kind of stretched not too bad I'll switch over to conform.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.080
Let's see if that helps at all.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.120
Not really.

03:42.740 --> 03:52.670
So we could try and alleviate some of this stretching by creating seems to edge mode maybe every edge

03:52.670 --> 04:02.560
here we could select and create a seam kind of a star pattern of seems here.

04:02.570 --> 04:03.450
Let's try this

04:06.720 --> 04:15.090
also like that in press control E. and Mark seen and now it's like everything and press you and unwrap

04:16.660 --> 04:20.830
and that looks pretty good that there isn't a whole lot of stretching there.

04:20.830 --> 04:29.200
There's some right there in the center for the pupil but I'm not sure we care too much about them because

04:29.230 --> 04:34.340
that's just going to be black that's just going to be a solid black color.

04:34.360 --> 04:37.480
Let's go with this and see how that works.

04:37.480 --> 04:47.230
All right so I'll go back to my default view and press alt h to bring everything back tab out of edit

04:47.230 --> 04:51.820
mode and I can press shift see to frame everything up.

04:52.030 --> 05:00.950
I'll switch over to my texture view and now we can see we've got a U-V map on the arm.

05:00.950 --> 05:03.880
The belt buckle and the thigh.

05:03.960 --> 05:08.190
Let's see what we can do with one of the legs here.

05:08.200 --> 05:18.860
So once again I'll go back to my solid view and to my U-V editing lay out here press Schiff's see and

05:18.880 --> 05:27.010
I'll tab into edit mode and just select this leg with the L key and then press shift h to isolate it

05:27.550 --> 05:33.990
and frame it up with the period key let me go back to solid view.

05:34.090 --> 05:37.190
And now let's think about this.

05:37.360 --> 05:44.380
I think what I'll need to do is break the boot apart from the legs so I'm like this edge and I will

05:44.380 --> 05:49.920
go ahead and go to control me and edge split.

05:49.930 --> 05:57.430
So now these should be two pieces if I hover over here and hit the L key you can see that these are

05:57.430 --> 05:59.940
two pieces now.

06:00.050 --> 06:06.480
I mean just think about the leg here I think we could just select this edge right here on the inside.

06:09.100 --> 06:18.650
Mark a seam control the more extreme and let's select this piece hover over it and press the key and

06:18.650 --> 06:21.050
press you and unwrap it.

06:21.050 --> 06:22.530
Not too bad.

06:22.640 --> 06:29.750
And what I've done is just select that seam on the inside of the leg where it will be seen the least.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.410
Let me switch over to texture view here.

06:33.550 --> 06:41.260
And there is our texture and it's looking pretty good of course there's going to be that seam down the

06:41.260 --> 06:46.660
middle but that's OK that's not going to be seen too much.

06:46.660 --> 06:53.380
All right let's turn back in the edit mode switch back to solid and let's take a look at this.

06:53.410 --> 06:53.970
The boot

06:56.920 --> 07:03.280
for this I know we're going to need an edge or a seam here.

07:03.300 --> 07:07.300
I want to break it out there so I'll go ahead and add a seam there.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.640
I know we want that Mark seam.

07:11.050 --> 07:13.600
But how do we want to split up the rest of it.

07:14.830 --> 07:22.830
We could say that there's a natural seam in the boot from the back and you could select this.

07:23.340 --> 07:30.640
We could also say maybe we want the edge to be similar to this edge over here and be on the inside.

07:31.070 --> 07:34.920
So no real wrong answer here it's really the way you want to do it.

07:35.040 --> 07:42.470
And what's going to work for your particular character and your particular boot or accessory or whatever.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.490
I think I'll first try it like this.

07:44.490 --> 07:48.540
I will try using this image right back here.

07:48.540 --> 07:53.790
I'm going to select this edge and then control click this edge and it will select everything in between

07:53.790 --> 07:54.660
there.

07:54.930 --> 08:05.080
Press Control and Mark scene I'll select an edge here to break that apart because this is really going

08:05.080 --> 08:12.110
to be a different type of texture I think from a lot of the other part of the boot.

08:12.160 --> 08:18.790
So I think having a seam there is only natural so I'll press control and Mark seem.

08:18.920 --> 08:26.210
And lastly I'm not sure if we're gonna need a seam across the top of the foot or even around the top

08:26.210 --> 08:27.440
of the ankle.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.750
Not sure how that's going to work.

08:30.110 --> 08:36.830
So what I'll do is all hover over here and press l and let's just go ahead and test this.

08:36.830 --> 08:45.830
I'll press l and click there and you notice that when I do that and hit the L key it only selects it

08:45.830 --> 08:46.970
by seam.

08:46.970 --> 08:52.730
In other words it hasn't selected these other parts that have seams around them.

08:52.730 --> 08:59.660
So what I can do is I can change from selecting it by seam and I can choose a material and that will

08:59.660 --> 09:01.610
select this whole thing.

09:01.610 --> 09:06.750
Now I can press you and unwrap and there we are.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.800
There is surprisingly little stretching here at the toe.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.100
I'm actually kind of surprised.

09:12.270 --> 09:16.250
I'm going to go and switch over to textured view and let's take a look at it.

09:17.450 --> 09:18.850
Well that's not too bad actually.

09:18.950 --> 09:22.310
The squares here are a little bit larger than over here.

09:23.890 --> 09:31.450
I might be able to add an edge here to alleviate some of that difference but I think I'm going to go

09:31.450 --> 09:35.600
with it I think right now let's go with that and see how it works.

09:35.610 --> 09:40.810
Now it's up here that's causing a problem I think this part is stretching a little too much.

09:41.020 --> 09:53.350
So I think what I'll do is select this edge and this edge or go ahead and add seems here and now let's

09:53.650 --> 09:59.290
select this again with the L key and hit you and unwrap.

09:59.380 --> 10:02.430
I still think this is having a problem.

10:02.470 --> 10:09.790
You can see it here and maybe the problem is is we need to split it out along this edge back here since

10:09.790 --> 10:14.750
it's a horizontal edge we probably need to do that press control.

10:14.800 --> 10:22.140
And Mark the seam here hover over press l and then you and unwrap.

10:22.630 --> 10:25.710
Yeah that's it right there.

10:25.870 --> 10:28.630
And that's looking a little better a mess.

10:28.630 --> 10:35.840
Change from angle based to conformal see if that helps any that kind of helped.

10:35.870 --> 10:41.520
The difference in size from the toe to the rest of the boot.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.680
I think that'll work just fine.

10:44.490 --> 10:46.230
Yeah.

10:46.310 --> 10:49.740
So let's press Allt age to bring everything else back.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.860
And I'll go back to the default view.

10:53.210 --> 10:57.950
Chris Schiff's see and switch over to the texture view.

10:58.230 --> 11:05.800
And so we can see now we've got the character's leg the glove the buckle and the eye.
