00:00.990 --> 00:05.850
So in the last video we were able to set up the contact poses.

00:05.850 --> 00:12.930
We've got a contact pose when the heel actually contacts the ground here on frame 1 and we've also got

00:13.110 --> 00:17.200
another contact pose here on frame 7.

00:17.280 --> 00:24.430
The next thing I like to do is to work on the passing pose and that usually happens right around frame

00:24.460 --> 00:30.570
for let's say and the passing pose is just when well the feet pass each other.

00:30.570 --> 00:36.940
So we begin here on frame one with the left foot closest to us.

00:37.020 --> 00:42.530
So we need to keep an eye on that foot as we move from frame one to frame.

00:42.530 --> 00:44.790
For here it is.

00:44.820 --> 00:50.550
Now we need to bring this foot down to be pushing off of the ground so it's just the toe on the ground

00:50.910 --> 00:58.140
pushing off and the other leg passing by on its way to the other contact post.

00:58.270 --> 01:00.870
So OK so let's take this foot here.

01:00.870 --> 01:08.400
The foot iCade left and I'll just move it down a bit and I think what I'll do is clear the rotation

01:08.400 --> 01:15.840
here so I'll press Allt are and that will clear the rotation and put it back parallel to the ground.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.170
Let's also take it down to the ground so we know it's flat on the ground.

01:20.190 --> 01:22.280
On a press all day G.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.690
And that will clear the location.

01:24.960 --> 01:35.210
And now I can rotate it back up onto the toe and move it straight back like that and the y axis and

01:35.210 --> 01:40.120
something like maybe get them push in off like that.

01:40.460 --> 01:42.320
Yeah something like that.

01:42.410 --> 01:44.680
And now this foot doesn't look too bad actually.

01:44.690 --> 01:51.030
I might rotate it down just a hair like that maybe even push it forward just a bit.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.370
There we go.

01:52.370 --> 01:54.690
All right so let's see how this works.

01:54.710 --> 01:58.150
We've got our contact pose.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.640
And then we've got our passing pose.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.890
And then back to our contact pose here again.

02:05.050 --> 02:09.500
We now need our passing pose at frame 10.

02:09.520 --> 02:15.850
So what I'll do is I'll hit the A key and select all of the controls here on the character on frame

02:15.850 --> 02:16.640
four.

02:17.170 --> 02:24.880
And let me just scroll over here and I'm going to go ahead and copy this post so I'll hit this button

02:24.880 --> 02:26.330
right here.

02:26.500 --> 02:30.280
Move the frame up to frame 10.

02:30.430 --> 02:37.470
And now let's paste this and flip it with this button here let's see if it works click that and then

02:37.470 --> 02:37.880
we go.

02:37.880 --> 02:50.330
So now we've got our passing poses at frame for and frame 10 and we've got our contact at 1 and 7.

02:50.330 --> 02:52.510
So let's hit play and see what happens.

02:53.380 --> 02:54.250
Get in there.

02:55.520 --> 03:02.190
Now so far all we've dealt with is just the legs we really haven't moved that center of gravity control.

03:02.220 --> 03:06.530
This one here that torso control up or down.

03:06.570 --> 03:11.780
But now let's start working on well the down position and the up position.

03:11.910 --> 03:21.660
So now that I have this selected it looks like I've got keyframes at 7 10.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.470
I don't have one for four here.

03:24.490 --> 03:28.200
I'm going to go ahead and insert a keyframe for four just so it's there.

03:28.210 --> 03:29.280
I'm going to hit.

03:29.680 --> 03:33.340
And I'll insert a keyframe for location.

03:33.720 --> 03:41.710
And we go just so I have one at each of those main poses so far and now the down position we can think

03:41.710 --> 03:49.500
of that as being around frame 2 and the down position is when the foot falls flat to the ground.

03:49.510 --> 03:57.160
So you've got it here with the contact and now it's going to fall flat to the ground like the toe slaps

03:57.160 --> 03:58.210
the ground.

03:58.600 --> 04:04.120
The weight of the character is going to come down on that leg which means the head is going to come

04:04.120 --> 04:05.600
down a bit as well.

04:05.980 --> 04:14.410
So so far now we've had on the contact and the passing poses the head and the hips or the torso have

04:14.410 --> 04:19.830
been in the exact same place for the down position they're going to go down.

04:20.170 --> 04:22.570
And for the up position they'll of course go up.

04:22.810 --> 04:31.540
So let's take this foot first of all and let's press alt are to clear the rotation clear the rotation

04:31.540 --> 04:33.710
here as well auld are.

04:33.730 --> 04:36.000
So now he is right down on the ground.

04:36.050 --> 04:42.660
Go ahead and press all G just to make sure and I'll slide this back forward some like this.

04:42.670 --> 04:48.940
So now his foot is right planted flat on the ground and I'm going to take this torso control and just

04:48.940 --> 04:51.160
move it straight down.

04:51.160 --> 04:56.550
Now the arms are going to kind of stay where they are because of the controls and that's OK for now.

04:56.590 --> 05:01.480
We'll deal with the arms a little bit later I kind of like to deal with one thing at a time.

05:01.810 --> 05:03.770
And this guy right here.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.560
Let me make sure we've got this cleared with all our.

05:07.580 --> 05:08.840
That's good.

05:08.840 --> 05:17.390
And this guy I'm going to rotate back a bit like this maybe swing it back a little bit more like that.

05:17.390 --> 05:18.580
There we go.

05:18.580 --> 05:23.730
So now it should come down and back up a bit.

05:25.740 --> 05:29.680
So he should come down and hit that ground like that now.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.060
This foot has come out too much.

05:33.090 --> 05:38.310
I'm just going to raise that back up just a bit like this and go.

05:38.530 --> 05:47.260
So now you can see his foot goes from the heel and slaps the ground as the weight of the character comes

05:47.470 --> 05:49.190
down onto that leg.

05:50.020 --> 05:54.340
I may even want to bring him down just a hair more like that.

05:54.340 --> 06:05.280
All right so he goes into the down position back up to the passing to the contact again.

06:05.450 --> 06:14.200
We've got the passing and the contact so now we could do is do the opposite of the down on frame 8 here.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.610
Why don't we do that.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.710
So let's go ahead and select everything.

06:18.710 --> 06:29.980
Copy it with this button here moved to frame 8 and paste it like so let's see how that works.

06:31.740 --> 06:32.280
All right.

06:32.380 --> 06:35.670
De-select everything with the achene now going to go forward.

06:35.670 --> 06:43.640
There's that down position passing contact.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.950
There's the new down position

06:48.320 --> 06:51.680
passing and contact.

06:51.940 --> 06:52.280
OK.

06:52.290 --> 06:55.830
So you can see the key frames here.

06:57.250 --> 07:01.450
So what's cool is so far we really only have three poses.

07:01.450 --> 07:09.730
We've got the contact pose the passing pose and the down and we've been able to copy and paste the opposite

07:09.730 --> 07:13.570
of each one of those to make our lives a little easier.

07:13.570 --> 07:19.800
The next thing we should do is the up position which is going to be just past the passing pose.

07:19.810 --> 07:27.850
So here we are frame 5 and the up position is going to find this front leg kind of almost straight and

07:27.850 --> 07:32.360
the toe just barely touching the ground and the torso up.

07:32.380 --> 07:35.230
So we we need to push that torso up a bit.

07:35.380 --> 07:42.250
But first of all what I would do is take this and hit Allt R and get rid of the rotations for these

07:42.250 --> 07:44.290
things called are here.

07:44.560 --> 07:49.620
And I think I'm going to go ahead and press alt G just to put it right back to the center.

07:49.840 --> 08:00.000
And then I'm going to drag this back and raise this up like that and I'm going to move that torso straight

08:00.000 --> 08:09.350
up I better grab those hands as well so we don't break the elbows as we drag him up.

08:09.350 --> 08:18.540
So I'll now drag that up and now I'll take this back just all the way I don't want to break the leg

08:18.540 --> 08:19.290
like that.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.130
I just want to get it.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.280
So it's really close to being straight.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.850
You don't want to bend anything backwards like that.

08:25.530 --> 08:32.400
So just so it's almost straight and this guy I mean make sure the rotation is clear on that.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.380
And I'm going to move him up.

08:36.670 --> 08:44.710
Pretty far out like this and maybe rotate it up just a bit like that let me see if I can move this back

08:44.710 --> 08:46.160
just a little bit.

08:47.040 --> 08:52.580
Maybe I'll bring him down a hair just so we don't break that leg.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.320
And here we go.

08:55.620 --> 08:55.940
All right.

08:55.950 --> 08:58.250
So that is our position.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.740
Let's see how that looks.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.460
So he goes down.

09:03.480 --> 09:03.750
All right.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.060
So here is the contact.

09:06.140 --> 09:13.210
The down position the passing PPOs the up position.

09:13.430 --> 09:14.850
I don't like this foot.

09:14.870 --> 09:17.940
What did I do here.

09:18.110 --> 09:21.240
Let me rotate this back then.

09:21.320 --> 09:25.490
I don't like that being up so far turned up like that.

09:25.850 --> 09:28.860
All right so now there's your contact.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.230
You're down.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.200
You're passing and your contact.

09:33.210 --> 09:33.660
OK.

09:33.660 --> 09:43.500
So let's now take this frame five and let's copy it and paste the opposite of it over at frame 11.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.550
All right so I'll select everything with the key.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.850
Copy everything.

09:48.790 --> 09:55.540
Move this over to frame 11 and paste and we go.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.490
All right.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.610
So let's see how this works.

09:58.770 --> 10:06.000
I'm going to go ahead and save go back to the beginning and hit play.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.500
We're getting there.

10:07.770 --> 10:14.850
There's some flopping us here at the end with the feet we'll need to work on that.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.300
But that's a good beginning.

10:17.300 --> 10:24.740
We've got the sense that he's going up and down that there's weight to the character Yeah I think that's

10:24.740 --> 10:25.510
going to work.

10:26.590 --> 10:27.460
All right.

10:27.760 --> 10:33.600
So in the next video what we'll do is we'll begin cleaning this up a bit.

10:33.700 --> 10:39.020
We'll begin working on the arms and see if we can finish up our run cycle.

10:39.070 --> 10:40.160
So see you then.
