00:00.690 --> 00:08.940
Well we've taken a look at using the grease pencil to draw out the typology of our low poly mesh.

00:08.940 --> 00:12.440
We've also taken a look at using the snap tools.

00:12.450 --> 00:16.210
Let's now take a look at one more of Blender's right apology tools.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.830
And that's the shrink wrap modifier.

00:18.870 --> 00:26.490
So with this modifier we can create an object and then actually shrink it down to the character so a

00:26.490 --> 00:31.410
good candidate for that I think would be the legs so let's try that.

00:31.440 --> 00:39.270
I'm going to come over here to the Create tab and create a new cylinder and for this I don't need 32

00:39.420 --> 00:51.930
sides maybe 12 and I'll turn the cap fell off by choosing nothing and I'm going to go ahead and use

00:51.930 --> 00:57.580
this depth field on my click and drag in this to make it a little bit taller.

00:58.760 --> 01:02.720
And maybe I'll use the radius to make it a little bit wider as well.

01:04.920 --> 01:10.400
I'm going to bring it up and kind of put it over one of the legs here.

01:10.470 --> 01:19.240
I'll also go to the four port view by pressing control alt Q And that'll give me this four window view.

01:19.350 --> 01:25.570
And this'll just make it a little easier I think to put that piece over the leg.

01:26.100 --> 01:29.310
So something like this.

01:29.310 --> 01:31.670
I mean rotated a bit.

01:31.780 --> 01:38.960
I'm just going to try and get it over the leg without any of the pieces of the leg sticking out.

01:38.960 --> 01:46.190
And we go in also I think I'm going to tap into edit mode and press control r and insert some edge loops

01:46.190 --> 01:50.810
here maybe let me try 6 edge loops here.

01:51.290 --> 01:52.620
Click.

01:52.670 --> 01:57.440
I'm going to press control alt cue to go back to the single view.

01:57.740 --> 02:05.840
And now what I can do is I can add a modifier here to this object and I'll add the shrinkwrapped modifier

02:07.190 --> 02:13.490
and this panel now gives me the option to choose what object I want to shrink this to.

02:13.490 --> 02:17.370
Now I've named all of my objects and one of them here is character.

02:17.630 --> 02:20.540
So I'll pull this down and choose character.

02:21.320 --> 02:27.890
And that allows that object to shrink to fit that piece of the character.

02:27.890 --> 02:35.990
So if I come over here to the object window I can scroll down and choose x ray and you can see how it's

02:36.230 --> 02:40.700
fit or shrunk to the object.

02:40.700 --> 02:41.840
That's kind of cool.

02:41.930 --> 02:47.470
And if I hit the tab key you can still see the original shape of the object.

02:47.990 --> 02:55.160
So now what I want to do is come back to the modifiers panel and just click apply and that will allow

02:55.160 --> 02:58.090
that to apply to that object.

02:58.130 --> 03:02.360
And now there's my low poly mesh for the leg.

03:02.360 --> 03:05.680
Now I'd like to mirror this over to the other side.

03:05.900 --> 03:12.320
To do that I need to move the pivot point down to the center of the grid or the 3D cursor here.

03:12.320 --> 03:22.460
So I'll just come over to the Tools panel here and set the origin of this object down to the 3D cursor.

03:22.460 --> 03:25.830
Now I can add a new modifier to that.

03:26.120 --> 03:30.980
The mere modifier and that'll mirror that over to the air.

03:30.980 --> 03:34.810
So now we have our legs read apologized.

03:34.820 --> 03:37.820
Let's try that again with the tunic here.

03:37.910 --> 03:45.410
I'm going to come over to my object panel and turn off x ray for a moment and I could even select this

03:46.220 --> 03:52.940
and move them over to the third layer where I have my other low poly objects so I'll just press em and

03:52.940 --> 03:55.170
move it to the third layer.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.010
We go.

03:57.080 --> 04:01.580
So now all of the read typology is kind of over here in one layer.

04:01.580 --> 04:05.090
I've got the clothes and accessories on another.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.130
And then the character here.

04:07.610 --> 04:19.100
So let's work on the little tunic here for this once again I'll just create a cylinder and I'll use

04:19.100 --> 04:28.310
the settings over here to adjust the size so the radius could be bigger and the depth could be a little

04:28.310 --> 04:29.720
bit smaller there.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.590
So try this

04:39.030 --> 04:41.670
and I'll just try and get this to size.

04:42.580 --> 04:49.570
And we go something like that and I'm going to need some cross sections in this so a press control r

04:49.570 --> 04:52.720
and scroll the mouse wheel some.

04:52.720 --> 04:59.600
And let's go with let's go with four here.

04:59.780 --> 05:02.740
All right so now let's shrink that.

05:02.810 --> 05:07.500
I'll add the shrinkwrap modifier.

05:07.720 --> 05:16.870
And this object I have named tunic middles so I'll choose that scroll down here to tunic middle and

05:16.870 --> 05:17.670
there we go.

05:18.790 --> 05:26.080
Now if I turn on x ray we can see it there Lastly let me try one of these boots.

05:26.150 --> 05:28.740
I'll go through the same process here.

05:28.970 --> 05:31.220
I'll create a new cylinder

05:35.330 --> 05:37.670
reduce the radius a bit.

05:37.670 --> 05:42.740
Increase the depth so it will fit around one of these boots.

05:47.590 --> 05:54.980
I'll increase the resolution some scroll the mouse wheel till I get a good number of Poly's here I think

05:54.980 --> 05:57.510
probably that should work.

05:58.810 --> 06:00.440
I'll then select that object.

06:01.250 --> 06:09.100
Add the shrinkwrap modifier and this particular object is named Well Boots.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.510
OK so I'll choose that from the list here.

06:14.490 --> 06:16.230
And that'll shrink that down.

06:17.300 --> 06:21.990
Let's take a look at that with x ray.

06:22.020 --> 06:23.050
That's not bad.

06:23.190 --> 06:32.200
I may need to add an edge loop right in here to give us a little more detail along the rim of the boot.

06:32.220 --> 06:40.560
I'll go ahead and apply that modifier and then tap into edit mode and right in here.

06:40.560 --> 06:50.890
I think I would need to add an edge right in here and then shrink that down a bit something like that

06:51.820 --> 06:55.540
so that it has the hint of that edge to it.

06:55.570 --> 07:05.710
I think what I can do is select this row of edges here is that there's four here and then four here.

07:05.710 --> 07:17.060
And let's take those and just extrude down like that one more time maybe right down here like this.

07:17.060 --> 07:25.210
And then we should be able to select this row of edges now and perhaps begin moving them forward.

07:25.310 --> 07:37.220
So I'll hit it for extrude and let's move this forward some like that and I'll just begin snapping these

07:37.220 --> 07:49.220
points to the boot.

07:49.270 --> 07:49.780
All right.

07:49.780 --> 07:54.900
With those snapped to the boot I can then take this now.

07:56.610 --> 08:05.910
And extrude it forward again so I'll hit the and move this forward some maybe shrink it down a bit the

08:05.910 --> 08:12.720
next one I'm going to go ahead and turn off the snapping tool and select this edge and I'll go ahead

08:12.750 --> 08:15.980
and extrude it forward.

08:16.030 --> 08:23.160
Eek he likes to put it forward here and I'll just do a little bit of adjustment without the snapping

08:23.160 --> 08:24.090
tools for now

08:28.440 --> 08:34.430
and Alex Strood again move this forward and scale it down a bit.

08:42.610 --> 08:43.790
And maybe one more

08:53.230 --> 09:01.180
we can look at this and see how to close up the toe here to do that.

09:01.180 --> 09:09.430
I think I'm going to take this to that layer 3 so I'll press him and layer 3 and just look at it in

09:09.430 --> 09:10.700
isolation here.

09:12.330 --> 09:16.140
Now there's a lot of different ways you can seal this up.

09:16.140 --> 09:23.940
I think what I'm going to do is take these four faces excuse me these four edges and extrude these down

09:24.750 --> 09:27.350
to the next row.

09:28.870 --> 09:32.200
And hook these up like this.

09:32.200 --> 09:36.640
So all these points and press all to him and at last

09:39.540 --> 09:49.680
and then I'll select this whole row again and do the same thing again just move these we go.

09:49.990 --> 09:59.540
All right there is a boot so I'll select this edge here and then all shift select this edge.

09:59.540 --> 10:05.800
And now I should be able to press control key and then choose bridge loops.

10:05.990 --> 10:07.250
And there we go.

10:07.250 --> 10:11.090
Now we've connected up the leg and the boots.

10:11.330 --> 10:19.790
So of course I could just press l over here and choose X and faces to get rid of that and then just

10:19.790 --> 10:21.260
mirror this again.

10:23.410 --> 10:26.560
And I've got the legs and the boots.

10:26.650 --> 10:27.100
All right.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.760
So we're moving along.

10:28.840 --> 10:35.350
We've got the boots the legs the little tunic thing still got a lot more work to do.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.150
But I think we're progressing nicely.
