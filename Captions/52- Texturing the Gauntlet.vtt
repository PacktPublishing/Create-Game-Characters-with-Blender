WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:03.340
Well I've got the boots pretty much done now.

00:03.510 --> 00:08.410
Let's go ahead and work on the gloves in kind of a similar way.

00:08.430 --> 00:14.400
I think I'm going to continue to use this same boot image to sample colors off of.

00:14.640 --> 00:22.020
I mean we already have a palette here for the boots with the colors but in case I need to sample anything

00:22.020 --> 00:25.500
directly again I've got this image here.

00:25.620 --> 00:32.670
So let's take a look at these arm straps these gloves these gauntlets whatever you want to call them

00:33.540 --> 00:37.330
with the normal map here in its slot.

00:37.530 --> 00:43.110
We added this normal map quite a few videos ago.

00:43.350 --> 00:48.450
We can see the normal map on the character here.

00:48.510 --> 00:55.020
We can turn it off here if we want to just to see what the textures are going to look like without the

00:55.020 --> 00:55.990
normal map.

00:56.110 --> 01:03.960
And you can see here on the tunic that the paint and the texture is just there to really highlight and

01:03.960 --> 01:06.450
emphasize what's in the normal map.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.730
So then we turn this back on.

01:09.150 --> 01:12.640
And so let's start working on the gloves here.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.450
Let me bring that image back.

01:15.470 --> 01:16.670
There we go.

01:17.010 --> 01:22.190
And for this let's just begin once again with the darker colors.

01:22.200 --> 01:30.090
I'm going to turn on the face masking first and just select the glove.

01:30.960 --> 01:38.520
And we go and it looks like that selected everything.

01:38.530 --> 01:46.260
So let's come in and well let's begin with this darker color I think that's it right there that we have.

01:46.660 --> 01:48.820
Let's take a look at our settings.

01:48.820 --> 01:55.570
We've got the brush loaded up with a texture here a procedural texture.

01:55.570 --> 02:02.500
We've got the brush mapping on random and we've got our jitter up and our spacing up some so let's see

02:02.500 --> 02:04.340
how this works.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.730
I'll also increase the strength of it so we can see what we're doing at the beginning.

02:08.980 --> 02:12.700
I'll hit the F key and increase the strengths and let's see what happens here.

02:14.920 --> 02:23.320
So we can just lay down some kind of random darker tones on to the glove here.

02:23.350 --> 02:31.840
I'm going to press alt f over this to center up my view around the glove and I'll tombola around that

02:31.870 --> 02:34.030
as well.

02:34.030 --> 02:41.550
All right so we've laid down kind of splotchy darker color here.

02:41.560 --> 02:47.040
Now let's come in and do the same thing with this lighter reddish color here.

02:47.310 --> 02:55.360
Maybe I'll decrease the size of the brush so maybe I'll press shift F and let's reduce the strength

02:55.390 --> 02:58.190
just to hear something like that.

02:58.420 --> 02:59.970
Let's see how this works.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.310
That's a little too much.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.660
Don't you think.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.220
Let's undo that.

03:08.220 --> 03:12.590
Bring the strength back some maybe increase the brush size and then we just try again.

03:12.780 --> 03:15.440
So much of this is just trial and error.

03:16.900 --> 03:22.650
At least for me maybe for someone else it would be easy and would happen to the right way.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.520
The first time every time.

03:25.520 --> 03:32.960
But for me I kind of have to go through some trial and error right.

03:33.050 --> 03:34.150
I'm OK with this.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.830
I think this is going to work out pretty well.

03:36.850 --> 03:41.630
A lot of what's happening here along the straps we're going to be painting over.

03:41.740 --> 03:46.930
So they're going to look more like the straps down here.

03:46.930 --> 03:49.930
Now let's see where this is happening on the U.V. map.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.860
I think it's happening over here.

03:52.930 --> 03:53.370
Yeah.

03:53.380 --> 03:57.540
So here's that glove U-V Island.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.940
And if we spin around here to the other side

04:03.670 --> 04:05.850
you can see it's happening over here too.

04:06.040 --> 04:12.670
And that's because those two U-V islands are one on top of the other here in the map.

04:12.710 --> 04:13.150
All right.

04:13.150 --> 04:15.830
So we've got those two colors down.

04:16.270 --> 04:22.920
Let's work on the lighter color here which I think is this right here.

04:23.110 --> 04:27.170
We've also got this one too and maybe we'll mix and match.

04:27.790 --> 04:28.960
Well let's try this one.

04:28.960 --> 04:35.320
I think I'll go with this lighter color for the splotches and maybe this one for the straps.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.020
Let's see how that works.

04:38.020 --> 04:45.630
So for this I'm going to increase it quite a bit now and let me just try this and that maybe too much.

04:45.630 --> 04:52.920
There we bring the strength down a little bit more and let's reduce the press size a hair and let's

04:52.920 --> 04:54.940
try this.

04:55.510 --> 05:00.340
And actually what I should do is maybe be a little more strategic on these.

05:00.340 --> 05:06.950
So let's think about where this would be scuffed up.

05:07.030 --> 05:12.820
So probably I would say it would be scuffed up down here along the palm of the hand right.

05:12.820 --> 05:19.730
So maybe we should be a little bit more precise about where we're putting this.

05:19.810 --> 05:29.210
So maybe along the fingers here we'd have scuff marks maybe down here where he puts his arm on a table

05:29.210 --> 05:30.870
or something.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.460
Do goblin's have tables.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.710
I guess they do right.

05:33.710 --> 05:34.820
I don't know.

05:35.730 --> 05:39.560
Maybe up here where he pulls the glove on.

05:39.630 --> 05:46.290
So maybe trying to be a little bit more thoughtful as to where these go.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.460
All right.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.660
I think that works pretty well.

05:49.660 --> 05:55.030
The next thing I'd like to do is work on the straps now and to do that I'm going to go in and save this

05:55.570 --> 05:56.550
scene.

05:56.550 --> 06:04.240
I'll come over here and save this image with old ass and then I'm going to come over to the slots tab

06:04.270 --> 06:09.210
and I'm going to go ahead and go to this straps texture paint slot.

06:09.250 --> 06:13.030
This is the one that I painted the boot straps on.

06:13.030 --> 06:14.690
So here they are.

06:14.950 --> 06:21.730
And as an aside and what I'll try and do here is Notice what I did here I tried to give one side kind

06:21.730 --> 06:27.710
of a highlight and the other side a shadow just to try and get them to pop out a bit.

06:27.790 --> 06:32.120
So that's kind of what I'll try to do over here as well.

06:32.140 --> 06:39.880
So for the color on the straps I think this is what I'm going to use for the straps.

06:40.270 --> 06:46.470
I will come down and take a look at the jitter and the spacing and I think that's OK.

06:46.630 --> 06:50.980
We'll try that then let's see how this works.

06:50.970 --> 06:57.340
So I'm going to come in here to this top strap and maybe reduce the brush size a bit and let's just

06:57.370 --> 06:58.450
test this out.

07:04.680 --> 07:12.910
Yeah I think that's kind of what I'm looking for and I like the fact that we've still got a texture

07:12.910 --> 07:13.980
on here.

07:13.990 --> 07:20.290
We're laying it down randomly and we've still got jitter on it it gives it a little bit of texture to

07:20.290 --> 07:25.280
it so it isn't just a flat solid color.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.020
So let's go with this.

07:27.020 --> 07:27.790
I like this.

07:27.790 --> 07:33.160
I'm going to go ahead and lay this down on the other straps as well.

07:33.980 --> 07:34.990
Yeah.

07:35.030 --> 07:38.270
All right so let's move down to the next one here.

07:41.890 --> 07:48.910
And the good thing about doing this on its own layer is if I accidentally come outside the lines here

07:48.910 --> 07:51.460
I can just flip the pin over and

07:54.570 --> 07:57.140
erase just a little bit there.

07:58.050 --> 08:06.160
Without destroying the other texture underneath and I'll keep going down here on the top of the hand.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.440
I've got two more down here on the top.

08:10.090 --> 08:17.220
And also I'm going to need to go through and do the seams on the glove too.

08:17.230 --> 08:26.900
I think if I recall I put some seams on the gloves so right in here I want to highlight these as well.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.910
Here's that one and then I'll get this down here.

08:33.570 --> 08:39.930
You know we go and sometimes you get these little glitches here and sometimes what you can do is come

08:39.930 --> 08:43.170
straight into the U-V map here.

08:43.170 --> 08:52.760
And if I've got it set up for paint sometimes you can come straight in here and paint right over that

08:54.320 --> 09:01.610
like that just to kind of fix those tiny glitches that you can get when you're painting directly on

09:01.610 --> 09:03.320
the model there.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.580
Those are the straps.

09:04.580 --> 09:07.850
Now let's take a look at the seams here.

09:07.880 --> 09:13.820
I'm going to reduce the brush size and for this seems I'm just going to come through and just add a

09:13.820 --> 09:15.650
little bit to this.

09:15.650 --> 09:24.380
I think then what I'll do is come in and with a darker color or highlight the edges or the shadows in

09:24.420 --> 09:26.070
between the seams here.

09:26.210 --> 09:27.740
Let's see how it works.

09:31.490 --> 09:34.420
Atlas come over here to the other side work on these

09:40.280 --> 09:48.740
and there's also some seams around the thumb and fingers so I'll just try and catch these while we're

09:48.740 --> 09:49.520
here.

09:51.590 --> 09:52.500
OK.

09:52.620 --> 09:57.000
So we have our seams and our straps down now.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.730
At least that initial color.

09:59.910 --> 10:06.840
Let's now go through and and some highlight and shadow on each of them just to help them pop a little

10:06.840 --> 10:11.670
bit more for the light up here on the top.

10:11.670 --> 10:15.390
Let's let's take this and just move it.

10:15.780 --> 10:18.440
And that may be a little bit too much.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.670
Maybe if we take this one now.

10:21.690 --> 10:27.130
Let me go in and actually find a new color for this.

10:27.170 --> 10:29.700
I kind of like this color right in here.

10:29.700 --> 10:34.430
I want to press the ESC key and come in here and grab this it's very similar to the one I already have.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.740
But I grab this one.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.110
I kind of like this.

10:38.280 --> 10:41.450
Let's use that all right.

10:41.710 --> 10:45.960
So now I take the strength down even more.

10:46.190 --> 10:48.300
And let's see if we can do with this.

10:48.380 --> 10:53.150
I just want a little highlight along the top of these straps here.

10:57.930 --> 11:00.750
Something like that yeah.

11:03.060 --> 11:06.110
So it's pretty subtle but I think it'll help

11:08.850 --> 11:12.970
gives some definition to the straps.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.420
And once again I've got that little glitch there.

11:17.470 --> 11:19.280
I'm going to come straight in here.

11:22.350 --> 11:33.590
And reduce the breast size and try and catch this here so we go OK.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.970
So now we've got those highlights.

11:36.240 --> 11:41.770
Maybe we should go through and do that similar thing on the seams.

11:41.790 --> 11:45.070
I'm not sure if we've got enough room to do it though.

11:45.270 --> 11:49.530
Let's go through and do the shadows first and then I'll go back and I think maybe all we need on the

11:49.530 --> 11:52.140
seams are shadows.

11:52.170 --> 12:00.570
Let's see if we can maybe use this or is this a little bit darker or let's see if we can sample a new

12:00.570 --> 12:01.250
one.

12:02.610 --> 12:05.490
What's this in here that looks pretty dark.

12:05.490 --> 12:09.680
That may be too much although it's not bad.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.550
Let's try this.

12:11.660 --> 12:13.320
That's interesting.

12:13.340 --> 12:15.920
It's kind of a deep red.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.010
Let's try that.

12:18.600 --> 12:25.620
For this I'll just go along the bottom here and try and add some shadow here.

12:27.350 --> 12:27.820
Yes

12:31.720 --> 12:35.410
going to in the shadow down onto the glove itself to

12:38.860 --> 12:41.460
try that.

12:41.780 --> 12:43.820
Let's go with that.

12:43.820 --> 12:51.370
All right now going to go in with this color and try and work on the creases of the seams.

12:51.370 --> 12:58.280
This may be a little too I don't know if this will be too much or not but let's give it a try.

12:59.680 --> 13:09.440
And just going to try and give it a little bit of extra shading here along the seams just so that when

13:09.440 --> 13:20.210
we turn off the normal map you can still see that there's some highlight some light and shade going

13:20.210 --> 13:21.220
on in here.

13:22.540 --> 13:23.110
All right.

13:23.120 --> 13:28.640
And I guess I will go ahead and try and put a highlight on this it may be a futile effort but I'll I'll

13:28.670 --> 13:30.110
try it.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.770
Let me go back to here.

13:32.630 --> 13:37.180
And this may just be too small of a detail to try and put in here.

13:37.190 --> 13:49.170
But let me try.

13:49.180 --> 13:49.960
All right.

13:49.960 --> 13:55.080
There may be more we can do here but I think that's pretty good for now.

13:55.090 --> 14:01.440
Let me get rid of the face masking and just take a look at what we've done so far.

14:01.850 --> 14:08.830
Yeah so we've got the straps and the seams and we've got them very similar to the way we've done the

14:08.830 --> 14:10.390
boots.

14:10.430 --> 14:13.110
I think that works pretty well.

14:13.270 --> 14:20.440
It looks like we've got all the clothes and accessories done which means I've I've put off doing the

14:20.440 --> 14:22.820
skin as long as I can.

14:22.870 --> 14:28.900
The skin is going to be more difficult and will probably take it one piece at a time.

14:29.050 --> 14:37.300
Trying to begin with the easiest and maybe least prominent parts of the skin maybe on the legs or something.

14:37.300 --> 14:46.190
But I'll go out and try and find some reference images of green skin that may be difficult.

14:46.210 --> 14:52.170
What comes to mind is Gomorrha from Guardians of the galaxy but I don't think I'll use that.

14:52.180 --> 14:59.770
I'll actually try and find some sort of real life animal with the green skin that we can use to sample

14:59.770 --> 15:01.660
our colors as we go.

15:01.660 --> 15:10.090
Now before we do anything let's be sure and go over to the slots tab and click save all images and make

15:10.090 --> 15:16.780
sure we've got everything saved and we don't have any asterisks is here.

15:16.780 --> 15:19.450
I'm going to go here to the details.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.640
Yep there we go.

15:20.830 --> 15:26.390
So I just want to make sure that everything is saved before I close out anything.

15:26.560 --> 15:31.460
And I'll also hit control the command s and save the scene there as well.
