00:00.860 --> 00:08.040
Let's take a look at this arm band Gauntlett glove type thing that we've got on the character.

00:08.300 --> 00:16.030
I think I'd like to begin sculpting on it but right now it's very thin it's just one sided.

00:16.040 --> 00:19.290
And I'd like to give it a little bit of thickness.

00:19.430 --> 00:26.000
Now I could use the solidify modifier on this but what I think I'll do for this one is just tab and

00:26.070 --> 00:33.930
edit moment here press control tab and choose edge and I'm just going to all to click the edge is here

00:34.820 --> 00:41.060
to select that whole edge loop and all I'll do is just hit the e key and extrude and then I'll hit the

00:41.060 --> 00:49.670
ESC key and just scale in and I'm just scaling in right into the hand there and that gives it the illusion

00:49.670 --> 00:51.490
of thickness at least.

00:51.650 --> 00:55.860
So I'll do the same thing here with me and then ask for scale.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.690
And I'll do that up here.

01:05.790 --> 01:11.520
Now what I'd like to know is how much of this thing is going to collapse or will this thing collapse

01:11.520 --> 01:18.330
too much when I add the multi resolution modifier or is it just going to collapse into a blob or is

01:18.330 --> 01:25.410
it going to hold some of these edges fairly well one way to test that it's just instead of using a multi

01:25.410 --> 01:34.320
resolution just add a subdivision surface and maybe move this view up to two and you can kind of get

01:34.320 --> 01:38.870
a sense of what's going to happen with that multi resolution modifier.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.210
And that I think is collapsing a little too much.

01:42.210 --> 01:46.950
I'd like to have the edges a little tighter when I collapse that.

01:46.950 --> 01:52.860
Now I can of course go in and sculpt and pinch these edges but I think it's sometimes a little easier

01:53.190 --> 01:55.600
to just add a few edge loops to hold them.

01:55.830 --> 02:03.000
So tab in the edit mode and you can kind of see now the cage over the smooth geometry and I'll just

02:03.000 --> 02:09.720
press control are and kind of drag that up and just try and hold that edge just a little bit better.

02:10.020 --> 02:13.170
Maybe one in here as well.

02:13.340 --> 02:15.850
I don't want it too tight just something.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.750
So it doesn't collapse terribly.

02:17.750 --> 02:23.960
And of course in the sculpting process I can always smooth those edges out a bit.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.500
So I'm not too worried about that.

02:26.930 --> 02:33.950
I'll go in and do the same thing in here for this one I think I'll just add an edge loop inside here

02:34.340 --> 02:39.950
and pull it out some and see if I can get one around here.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.600
And maybe in here as well.

02:45.600 --> 02:52.360
So that just helps hold the edges just a little bit better than they would have otherwise.

02:52.360 --> 02:58.750
So now that I've done that I can come back over here to this subdivision surfaces modifier and just

02:58.900 --> 02:59.730
remove it.

03:00.610 --> 03:04.820
And now I can begin again with the multi resolution one.

03:05.210 --> 03:10.770
So I've got a couple of reference images over here I've got this one from my drawing.

03:10.940 --> 03:15.080
These drawings are really just kind of ideas for me to go toward.

03:15.140 --> 03:20.930
I don't really know exactly what I was doing here and how that's going to look on the 3D model or what

03:20.930 --> 03:25.650
that's going to be but it's just something to move towards.

03:25.910 --> 03:28.450
I've got this reference image here.

03:28.460 --> 03:36.050
I like the little seams or thread lines here on the model I think I want to somehow get that kind of

03:36.050 --> 03:37.060
thing on there.

03:37.430 --> 03:44.540
And although I don't want these buckles I thought these were nice in that they kind of mirrored what

03:44.540 --> 03:46.530
I was doing here.

03:46.640 --> 03:54.150
So I just wanted this up while I'm sculpting so I have some sort of visual reference.

03:54.340 --> 03:55.850
All right so let's give this a try.

03:55.850 --> 04:07.900
I'll go ahead and add a multi resolution modifier to this and click subdivide and there's one there's

04:07.900 --> 04:13.860
two go ahead and hit it with three for now and see how that works.

04:13.970 --> 04:21.050
Also come over here to the Tools tab and under shading and click on smooth and that'll smooth that up

04:21.050 --> 04:21.840
quite a bit.

04:22.950 --> 04:32.530
So now I'm going to go over to sculpt mode here and click sculpt and let's see what we can do here.

04:32.670 --> 04:39.960
I'm just going to click on the icon and go straight over to the sculpt draw tool and just to test this

04:39.960 --> 04:40.720
out.

04:40.740 --> 04:44.400
Let's see about my strength of the brush.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.360
Just try that.

04:46.590 --> 04:51.730
It's not too bad.

04:51.880 --> 04:57.610
I think I can work with this for now just to bring the shape of the glove out a bit.

04:57.670 --> 05:02.880
I'm going to probably need to add a subdivision or two to get more detail on it.

05:02.890 --> 05:05.450
But for now let's work with this.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.030
Bring the strength down a bit

05:12.020 --> 05:17.180
increase the radius let's just see what we can do here.

05:19.900 --> 05:24.470
Just want to sculpt this out and get this out over the palm of the hand here.

05:26.520 --> 05:32.820
And if I press shift and stroke it will smooth it back a bit.

05:32.970 --> 05:38.380
I just want to hint at some of the structure in the hand just by sculpting out a bit here.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.300
Bring that out.

05:44.420 --> 05:50.320
Maybe I need more volume over the hand here the top of the hand

05:54.570 --> 05:56.310
and down here around the arm.

05:56.310 --> 05:58.020
I'll bring these out a bit to

06:02.860 --> 06:05.760
looking a little too much like a cast.

06:05.760 --> 06:14.320
Like he broke his arm so when I want to do is bring in the wrist some I think and I'll just use the

06:14.590 --> 06:25.000
Shift key to smooth that in see if that'll work some and I'll also use the Control key I'll push that

06:25.570 --> 06:31.270
and stroke in that will cut in just a bit into the glove here.

06:32.690 --> 06:38.430
And I think I'd like to pull this edge out just a bit so I'll go over to the grab tool here.

06:39.430 --> 06:46.610
And maybe increase the size by pushing the F key and moving the mouse a bit.

06:46.670 --> 06:57.540
I just want to drag that out just a hair to get the shape of that arm piece a little bit wider They're

07:00.020 --> 07:02.240
come around the bottom and do the same thing.

07:02.240 --> 07:06.840
I think.

07:07.100 --> 07:07.450
All right.

07:07.450 --> 07:11.720
So I think now I want to start working on these bands whatever these are.

07:11.720 --> 07:18.840
I'm not exactly sure I think there are more decorative overlays rather than actual bands.

07:19.070 --> 07:25.820
So what I'm going to do is come over to the mask tool here and I'll press the F key and reduce the size

07:26.240 --> 07:34.580
of the brush a bit and I think I'll just use the mass to kind of draw out these things and then sculpt

07:34.580 --> 07:36.480
them out from there.

07:36.590 --> 07:47.060
So let's see if I take the mast tool and I'll just begin here and just draw out what I think might be

07:47.780 --> 07:49.710
one of those bands here.

07:51.280 --> 07:58.710
Let's just test this before I do all the rest of them here let's just test one and see what we think.

07:58.720 --> 08:08.110
So now that I have that press control I to invert the mask and then let's just come over to let's use

08:08.110 --> 08:16.960
the clay strips and I'll increase the brush size a bit maybe reduce the strength and let me just try

08:18.090 --> 08:23.160
and gently sculpt in here with clay strips.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.370
See what I can get.

08:27.740 --> 08:33.630
OK so now I can come down here to hide mask and I can clear the mask here or I can press Alt.

08:33.630 --> 08:36.350
Am so clear that.

08:36.410 --> 08:42.770
So we've got the beginnings of that strap or that inlay thing.

08:42.770 --> 08:50.360
It's not real great and this is why I'm testing it here and I choose the pinch to here and let's come

08:50.360 --> 08:51.320
in here.

08:52.360 --> 08:59.110
See if we can pinch this a bit to make it a little tighter around the edges.

08:59.380 --> 09:05.780
Something like this.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.870
Something like that.

09:07.940 --> 09:12.140
So you got kind of this hint of a strap there.

09:12.140 --> 09:18.320
Now if the viewport isn't quite the way you want it if you're having trouble seeing what you're doing

09:18.320 --> 09:24.140
here you can always change the way it's viewed with Blender's madcaps.

09:24.260 --> 09:29.630
So I'm going to press the end key here to bring up the properties panel and imma scroll down here.

09:30.500 --> 09:34.180
And right down here under shading.

09:34.460 --> 09:42.950
You've got a selection for matte cap and if I click that you can see how the way the model is being

09:42.950 --> 09:45.200
displayed is changing.

09:45.200 --> 09:52.250
Now this doesn't affect how the model is rendered or will ultimately be seen but what it does is it

09:52.250 --> 09:55.780
allows you to kind of get a better look at it here in the viewport.

09:55.790 --> 10:04.160
So I'm going to click this ball icon and I can choose different types of materials that my model can

10:04.160 --> 10:05.450
be viewed with.

10:05.480 --> 10:10.810
So I kind of like this one here to be able to see what I'm doing.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.770
Now you can choose any of them.

10:12.770 --> 10:19.740
I mean this is an interesting line and this is interesting and that's a little too much.

10:20.210 --> 10:28.430
But they're really good to kind of play with and see what kind of materials helps as you work on the

10:28.430 --> 10:29.050
model.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.380
So for me this one works pretty well.

10:31.580 --> 10:36.730
So when you press the end key to close that again and that's about all I want.

10:36.740 --> 10:44.090
Now there's another thing I wouldn't mind doing I might try and go back to the mast tool and really

10:44.090 --> 10:50.090
shrink the brush down and then draw around this thing.

10:50.090 --> 10:57.230
Let me see if this will work if I come around it here like this and I may need to add a subdivision

10:57.230 --> 10:58.940
here to be able to do this.

10:58.970 --> 11:00.410
Why don't I do that.

11:00.620 --> 11:08.240
I'll undo that with control or command Z and I'll come over here and I'll add I'll add two more subdivisions

11:08.240 --> 11:09.050
to it.

11:09.470 --> 11:12.440
And now if I draw on it it's a little cleaner.

11:14.520 --> 11:18.630
So I'm just going to draw a line all the way around here.

11:19.230 --> 11:24.840
So what I want to do is add kind of a seam around it.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.400
I'm not sure that this will work.

11:28.260 --> 11:31.240
But it's fun to try.

11:31.240 --> 11:39.270
All right so now I'm going to press control and I'm going to come back over to my sculped brush increased

11:39.400 --> 11:48.150
the brush size and come in here and just sculpt just a little bit around this like this.

11:48.160 --> 11:57.800
All right so now press all to him to clear it and it's OK but I think it's a little too much.

11:57.900 --> 12:04.620
So maybe if I come back with the smooth tool I'm just going to press shift and smooth that back a bit

12:06.150 --> 12:17.570
and maybe if I come in here with the inflate brush and zoom in here I can maybe inflate this up inside

12:17.580 --> 12:27.310
here just a little bit so I'm just testing actually this is I was as I said sometimes I'll draw something

12:27.880 --> 12:35.130
in the heat of the moment and not really understand or know how it's going to be translated into 3D

12:35.140 --> 12:40.030
and sometimes you've just got to come in and test it out and see what you think.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.520
That's kind of what I'm doing here.

12:42.760 --> 12:49.330
And yeah I think that'll work pretty well so I'm going to go in and start working on the other pieces

12:49.330 --> 12:52.240
like this and see what I can come up with.

12:52.240 --> 13:01.410
So I'll go back to my mask tool and come in here and let's start masking this out again.

13:06.690 --> 13:10.870
And I'll work on the next one here just right down here I think.

13:15.160 --> 13:21.760
And even though I've got three little stripes down here on the top of the hand I think I just try to

13:22.840 --> 13:26.180
do that and we try that and see how it works.

13:29.650 --> 13:33.610
So I've got my masks laid out here.

13:33.730 --> 13:38.310
I'll press control need to invert the selection there.

13:38.830 --> 13:44.550
And let's go back to the scopes draw brush and give this a try.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.760
We'll just use that to bring it out a bit.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.090
All right so is press Alt.

14:00.090 --> 14:03.340
Him to clear the mask.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.880
And I actually like those better than that up there.

14:08.420 --> 14:09.870
Well let's give this a try.

14:09.890 --> 14:15.950
Now we could probably go in and smooth this out a bit smooth this back some

14:19.390 --> 14:23.910
like so and go in and redo that.

14:23.950 --> 14:24.810
Let's try it.

14:26.760 --> 14:33.270
So now I'm going to go back and hit the mask brush and I'll just draw this out again because I like

14:33.270 --> 14:37.840
the look of that better than I had before.

14:37.840 --> 14:42.060
I think it's because I've increased the subdivisions here a bit.

14:42.060 --> 14:45.850
So let's draw this out again and see if we can get that a little bit better.

14:48.440 --> 15:00.550
All right so control I now go back to the sculpt draw brush and let's try this one.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.620
And then Allt him to clear

15:05.570 --> 15:11.770
and yeah I actually like that a little better than I had it with that seam around it.

15:11.790 --> 15:12.750
So there you go.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.210
I think I'm going to go with that for now.

15:15.210 --> 15:22.110
The next thing for the glove would be to create these little threads seems along maybe the inside and

15:22.110 --> 15:26.850
the outside edge and around the fingers and armhole here.

15:27.270 --> 15:33.090
But in the end I think you can see that sometimes you just need to test sometimes you just need to jump

15:33.090 --> 15:39.240
in and see what you can get because it's hard to know sometimes exactly what you're going for and exactly

15:39.300 --> 15:41.850
what the tools can do for you.

15:41.850 --> 15:44.700
So be sure and use a little trial and error in your art work.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.690
You just never know what you can get.
