00:00.620 --> 00:03.410
Let's see if we can get our character moving around now.

00:03.770 --> 00:10.340
So if we hit play we can see what we've done so far is we've got an idle animation running as soon as

00:10.340 --> 00:11.690
we turn on the game.

00:11.900 --> 00:19.410
We can push the up arrow and he can run and we can hit the spacebar and he can jump.

00:19.610 --> 00:20.130
All right.

00:20.150 --> 00:24.560
So if we come back here and let's open up that script again.

00:25.330 --> 00:30.010
And what we want is for our character to move forward when we push that up key.

00:30.010 --> 00:37.290
So it's going to be in here in this if statement when we say if we get an input from the up key.

00:37.330 --> 00:45.430
So I'm just going to put a line right here and we're using that move direction variable to push him

00:45.490 --> 00:49.480
up for the jump and for gravity pushing down.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.030
Let's go ahead and use that again for moving him forward.

00:53.290 --> 01:01.900
So we'll use that move direction right here and we'll say that that's going to be equal to him moving

01:01.900 --> 01:03.130
forward.

01:03.460 --> 01:11.980
So here's transformed dart forward and we're going to multiply that that vertical axis here let's input

01:12.040 --> 01:13.360
get access

01:16.560 --> 01:20.520
and we're going to put vertical in here.

01:20.760 --> 01:30.600
And then what we want to do is multiply this times some speed and we can create a variable called speed

01:30.630 --> 01:31.580
that we can put in there.

01:31.590 --> 01:39.760
And then in the inspector we can adjust the speed on the fly after testing to see how fast our character

01:39.760 --> 01:41.160
should move.

01:41.160 --> 01:50.590
So let's come up here and let's put a public float once again so we can adjust it in the inspector we'll

01:50.660 --> 01:57.310
call it speed and we'll set it to I don't know how about 25.

01:57.320 --> 02:00.650
Let's just try 25 and see how fast that's going to be.

02:00.650 --> 02:07.100
There's really no way to know at this point in time we'll just put a number in there and see now just

02:07.100 --> 02:09.920
like the run animation.

02:10.010 --> 02:15.190
We're going to want him to be able to come to a stop when we pull our finger up off the up arrow.

02:15.410 --> 02:22.730
So we need something down here in the else statement that will do that for us.

02:22.730 --> 02:26.910
So what we can do is just take this whole thing and take this whole line.

02:27.110 --> 02:35.310
Copy it paste it and instead of speed let's just put zero that'll stop him right.

02:35.730 --> 02:37.370
Let's try that.

02:37.380 --> 02:41.080
All right so let's save our script and let's go back to unity.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.690
Make sure there are no errors down here.

02:44.190 --> 02:48.220
Let's hit play and let's see what happens.

02:48.220 --> 02:54.250
So I'll hit the up arrow and he goes it keeps going.

02:54.330 --> 02:56.440
All right let's stop that.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.870
Let's see what happens here.

02:57.870 --> 03:00.790
Now the reason why he kept going.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.610
It looked as if our else statement didn't work.

03:04.770 --> 03:08.790
But the reason why he kept going is because he wasn't grounded.

03:08.790 --> 03:10.790
He went off at the ground.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.950
So what we need is to increase the size of our ground there.

03:15.270 --> 03:19.470
And also it's going to be hard to see if he's moving if it's just plain white.

03:19.560 --> 03:29.980
So let's do this let's select this plane and let's increase the scale about 10 in the X and 10 and the

03:30.010 --> 03:30.740
Z.

03:30.740 --> 03:36.860
Let's try that and then we really ought to have some sort of texture on here so we can tell if we're

03:36.860 --> 03:37.850
moving.

03:38.120 --> 03:42.230
Let's bring in an important new asset.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.450
And I've got a checker pattern somewhere on my drive.

03:45.450 --> 03:47.170
I'm going to bring that in.

03:47.370 --> 03:52.700
I'm just going to search for checker and here it is.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.220
I'll just take this and drag it in.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.220
And there we go.

03:57.220 --> 04:02.710
So now we've got this checkered pattern in our assets window here and I'm just going to drag that right

04:02.710 --> 04:05.140
onto the plane and there we go.

04:05.560 --> 04:05.880
All right.

04:05.890 --> 04:11.140
If I select the plane and take a look at it's material here.

04:11.620 --> 04:19.560
We could increase the tiling this x and y of tiling maybe increase that to three for each.

04:19.570 --> 04:20.730
Here we go.

04:21.030 --> 04:27.150
Yes so now I'm going to select my character and zoom in with the key is.

04:27.280 --> 04:33.900
So now we can see him moving around on this ground plane and he won't fall off so easily.

04:33.900 --> 04:39.900
So if I hit play again now if I hit the up arrow there we go.

04:39.970 --> 04:43.040
He can run but he can't turn.

04:43.150 --> 04:46.180
Just close in one direction and that's it.

04:46.210 --> 04:46.600
All right.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.580
So now we need him to turn.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.530
How do we get him to turn.

04:50.530 --> 04:55.060
Well I think we're going to need a couple of new variables and one of the variables we can actually

04:55.060 --> 04:58.850
create right down here within our if else statements.

04:58.850 --> 05:03.830
So let me go right here create a new line here and what let's do.

05:03.850 --> 05:08.940
Let's create a new float variable and we'll just call it turn.

05:09.090 --> 05:12.240
And what this is doing is looking for input

05:16.190 --> 05:25.450
on the horizontal axis or those arrow keys the left and right arrow keys and where we go and we can

05:25.450 --> 05:33.160
do that down here as well I believe we're going to need this down here and we go just copy and paste

05:33.160 --> 05:35.680
that down to the else statement.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.910
And now what we want to do is we want to transform instead of forward.

05:40.030 --> 05:53.270
We want to transform rotate the rotate and we can say that for the x y and z axis we only want to rotate

05:53.360 --> 05:55.200
around the y axis.

05:55.220 --> 05:59.210
So for this particular command the X is going to be zero.

05:59.600 --> 06:07.710
Right the Y will use that turn variable because that's what's getting the input.

06:07.780 --> 06:09.340
We'll multiply that times.

06:09.340 --> 06:16.900
Yet another new variable called Turn speed will have to create that up with the other variables.

06:16.900 --> 06:23.260
You can see how it's red now and we'll multiply that instead of by the frame rate.

06:23.260 --> 06:28.510
We don't want to use the possibly fluctuating frame rate for this.

06:28.510 --> 06:34.930
We want to use time so we'll use time delta time and for these Z.

06:34.960 --> 06:39.790
We just want to rotate 0 degrees like that.

06:39.790 --> 06:46.960
So you've got the X Y and Z and we're just rotating around the Y.

06:47.410 --> 06:50.500
So yes this turn speed we need to deal with don't we.

06:50.500 --> 06:58.630
So let's copy this let's bring it up here and let's once again create a public float we'll call it turn

06:58.630 --> 07:01.900
speed and we'll set it equal to.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.790
No idea.

07:05.110 --> 07:07.540
I'm going to set it to 60 and see how we do.

07:07.690 --> 07:09.320
Here we go.

07:09.610 --> 07:10.500
All right.

07:10.750 --> 07:15.670
So now that we have this line of code we should just be able to take this and move it down here.

07:15.670 --> 07:21.970
Now what that's going to mean is he's just going to slide on the ground and turn when he's in the idle

07:22.000 --> 07:23.290
position.

07:23.290 --> 07:31.040
A lot of character controllers like this are player scripts will have the camera move around the character.

07:31.180 --> 07:37.420
When you move say the arrow keys or or something and then when you hit forward it'll push the character

07:37.420 --> 07:41.050
or move the character forward opposite the camera.

07:41.050 --> 07:46.840
All we're doing here is just having him slide around turn as the camera turns.

07:47.030 --> 07:50.620
Or I guess the camera is actually following him as he turns.

07:50.620 --> 07:57.160
So this is pretty stripped down but I just wanted to get us through setting up a very basic player script

07:57.160 --> 07:58.330
here.

07:58.330 --> 08:01.070
All right so let's save this and let's just test this out.

08:01.330 --> 08:05.950
So we'll go back to unity makes sure we don't have any errors.

08:06.400 --> 08:16.380
And if I hit play there he is we can go forward and if I hit the up arrow and one to the left or right

08:16.410 --> 08:20.580
arrows I can turn him up but not fast enough.

08:20.670 --> 08:21.570
Let me try that again.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.600
Let me see how quickly I can turn him.

08:24.030 --> 08:26.100
Oh he's moving pretty good he turns.

08:26.190 --> 08:27.590
I want him to.

08:27.780 --> 08:29.380
He keeps running off.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.140
I want him to turn a little bit faster than that.

08:32.310 --> 08:39.000
So what I can do is select the character and let's come down to turn speed I'm going to take this up

08:39.000 --> 08:40.060
to 100.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.950
Let's try that.

08:42.090 --> 08:42.370
All right.

08:42.390 --> 08:49.810
Oh and I wanted to take the speed down to 10 and let me try that.

08:49.850 --> 08:50.170
All right.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.040
So here he goes.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.560
He's moving a little bit slower now.

08:52.580 --> 08:53.740
There we go.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.160
That's a little better.

08:56.180 --> 08:56.810
All right.

08:56.810 --> 09:07.380
So he's moving around and turning good now you can jump and see you can jump.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.680
He's kind of still running after I hit jump.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.940
Let's take a look at why that's happening.

09:12.960 --> 09:18.330
I think that's because if we go back over here to the animator I think that's because we haven't turned

09:18.330 --> 09:21.420
off exit time for all of these transitions.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.730
We turned them off.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.690
Let's move this down.

09:26.110 --> 09:31.020
We turned off exit time here for these two transitions right.

09:31.150 --> 09:32.690
But we didn't do it for these.

09:32.690 --> 09:39.310
And we turned these off and the reason why I'm turning this off is I just want each of these clips to

09:39.310 --> 09:45.520
be triggered immediately and looks like I've got exit time turned off there so I just didn't have them

09:45.520 --> 09:46.580
turned off here.

09:46.780 --> 09:47.410
OK.

09:47.650 --> 09:53.110
So let's hit our play button again and let's start running.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.800
And let's jump Yeah that's a little bit better.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.230
I get a better reaction.

10:00.900 --> 10:01.590
With that.

10:01.590 --> 10:02.140
Yeah.

10:02.160 --> 10:02.440
Good.

10:02.460 --> 10:03.380
OK.

10:03.870 --> 10:09.900
So the last thing I'd like to do is just add a few objects in here to the scene so he can run in and

10:09.900 --> 10:11.050
jump on them.

10:11.070 --> 10:16.170
So I just right clicked in the hierarchy and I'm going to go to a 3D object and I'll just create a cube

10:16.170 --> 10:19.860
here and you going to scale it up.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.230
There it is.

10:21.420 --> 10:26.680
And I'm just going to move it around and he can run around and jump on these things a bit.

10:27.810 --> 10:30.960
Well I just added a few obstacles here and that's all.

10:30.960 --> 10:38.070
If I select my character and I hit the F key I can zoom back in to him and let's hit the play button

10:38.070 --> 10:40.530
and just see how he looks.

10:41.430 --> 10:42.070
There he is.

10:42.070 --> 10:46.280
So now I can move maybe jump.

10:46.630 --> 10:47.490
Yeah.

10:47.830 --> 10:52.020
And let's turn around here and see what else we can find.

10:54.060 --> 11:02.450
So we can just run around and jump on things and just test and play around.

11:02.970 --> 11:03.900
Why not.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.200
Well I hope this has been helpful for you.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.600
I've had a lot of fun doing this.

11:09.600 --> 11:17.270
This is my favorite part of the whole process seeing your character run around and jump on things.

11:17.550 --> 11:24.100
So thank you for watching this game character creation series we've done a lot of work in Blender.

11:24.450 --> 11:33.690
We've gone through the whole process of modeling sculpting read typology U.V. mapping texturing rigging

11:33.900 --> 11:37.650
animation and finally importing into a game engine.

11:37.650 --> 11:38.640
It's been a lot of fun.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.590
I love doing this and I hope it was useful for you.

11:41.940 --> 11:44.700
Well thanks for watching and see you next time.
