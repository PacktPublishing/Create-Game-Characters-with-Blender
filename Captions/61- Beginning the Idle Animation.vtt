WEBVTT

00:00.850 --> 00:05.880
Before we begin animating there are some housekeeping chores that I think we need to take care of here.

00:05.890 --> 00:10.500
The first thing I'll do is go straight over to the animation screen lay out.

00:10.720 --> 00:16.700
I'm just going to click here and go to animation and this will give me just kind of a nice screen play

00:16.750 --> 00:20.500
out with the dope she the graph editor.

00:20.860 --> 00:26.530
Of course you've got the timeline down here with blender as you know you can configure things any way

00:26.530 --> 00:31.490
you want but I think this is a nice screen layout to begin with as we animate.

00:32.110 --> 00:34.720
I've got this relationship line right here.

00:34.720 --> 00:40.990
I don't think I want that I'm going to press the End key and let me scroll down to the display area

00:40.990 --> 00:48.840
which is here and we can turn off relationship lines right here so that cleans that up a bit.

00:48.850 --> 00:56.740
Now I'm going to begin with an idle cycle just the cycle of animation that runs when the game character

00:56.740 --> 00:59.090
is doing nothing at all really.

00:59.140 --> 01:04.660
And I'll probably do that between frames 1 and 40.

01:04.660 --> 01:07.920
I'm going to begin with that and just see how that works.

01:07.930 --> 01:14.080
However what I want to do is I want a key the default pose here on zero.

01:14.080 --> 01:21.340
So I've got it on frame 1 here and just I'm going to scroll back to frame zero and I'll select one of

01:21.340 --> 01:24.350
the controls and hit the key to select everything.

01:24.580 --> 01:33.070
And now if I hit the I key on the keyboard I get the insert key frame menu and I can choose to insert

01:33.070 --> 01:40.980
key frames for just location just rotation or all of them combined here and I'm just going to do that.

01:40.990 --> 01:48.130
I'm going to key the location rotation and scale for everything here at frame zero.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.670
Just so I have it open this up just a bit swing and see.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.220
So now if I scroll down here you can see I've got a keyframe for every single thing on that on that

01:58.220 --> 01:58.900
rig.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.980
It's just something I like to do it.

02:02.060 --> 02:10.520
It isn't absolutely mandatory but I like to be able to have that default pose available to me if I want

02:10.520 --> 02:18.110
to come back and copy that because I'll be moving these animation cycles around on the timeline.

02:18.110 --> 02:20.580
All right so I'll go back to frame one here.

02:20.620 --> 02:21.920
There we go.

02:22.520 --> 02:28.720
And now that I've key framed everything I can turn on Otto keyframe here.

02:28.970 --> 02:30.580
And what that will do is.

02:30.590 --> 02:38.360
Now every time I move anything it will automatically create a keyframe for me on that frame for it to

02:38.360 --> 02:38.720
work.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.860
You need to keyframe something first.

02:42.860 --> 02:46.330
Now some of these controls I'm really not going to need.

02:46.370 --> 02:55.430
Like I've already rotated and placed the fingers around the objects so I'm not going to be using these

02:55.430 --> 02:56.940
controls any more.

02:57.050 --> 02:58.550
So I'd like to kind of hide them away.

02:58.550 --> 03:06.840
I think they're kind of kind of distracting if I'm going to select this control through the shield.

03:06.940 --> 03:09.950
I've got all this here and I don't want that.

03:09.950 --> 03:18.590
So if I select one of these controls Now let me open this up a bit go to my armature panel you can see

03:18.590 --> 03:23.450
that with this control selected this layer is highlighted.

03:23.450 --> 03:30.890
So if I shift click this that turns that layer off and hides those objects let me do the same thing

03:30.890 --> 03:35.210
with the finger controls here if I select that one.

03:35.210 --> 03:36.540
You can see there it is.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.650
And if I shift click that that hides that away as well.

03:41.660 --> 03:42.200
All right.

03:42.290 --> 03:50.540
So now if I come over here and take a look at it through the shield my hand controls don't clutter up

03:50.750 --> 03:52.050
the viewport.

03:52.090 --> 03:52.350
All right.

03:52.370 --> 03:55.490
Everything else I think I will probably need.

03:55.490 --> 03:59.210
Now I said I'd begin with frames 1 through 40.

03:59.210 --> 04:03.410
So let's go ahead and type in 40 here to the end.

04:04.180 --> 04:09.470
And now we can middle mouse button click and drag and frame this up.

04:09.670 --> 04:12.820
I can scroll the mouse wheel and zoom in a bit.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.830
So now I can just see frames 1 to 40.

04:16.840 --> 04:22.490
Now this may change I'm not sure if this is exactly what I'll be using but that's OK.

04:22.900 --> 04:26.190
Look how I can select the character and I don't want to do that.

04:26.190 --> 04:30.850
I want to only be able to select the control object for the rig.

04:30.940 --> 04:37.570
So I'm going to select the character I'll hover over the outliner and press the period key on the numpad

04:37.600 --> 04:40.990
and that zooms in to my selected object.

04:40.990 --> 04:48.340
And now I want to turn off the select ability here of my character and I want to do the same thing for

04:48.340 --> 04:56.890
the eyes for the hammer and the shield so that when I select things over here I don't accidentally select

04:56.950 --> 05:02.160
the object or the character I only select the control rig.

05:02.410 --> 05:02.800
All right.

05:02.830 --> 05:04.670
I think that's going to help.

05:05.080 --> 05:13.900
So the idol I'm going to select this control object and let's move it down just a little bit so he kind

05:13.900 --> 05:18.850
of takes the weight like this.

05:18.980 --> 05:25.980
I kind of want to have the hand controls come down as well so I'll shift select those and bring those

05:25.980 --> 05:30.160
down just a bit like that.

05:30.170 --> 05:31.550
There we go.

05:31.750 --> 05:36.780
I want to make sure his center of gravity is over his feet.

05:36.880 --> 05:42.360
So I'll go to my side view here and just make sure that it's right over those feet.

05:42.370 --> 05:45.390
I don't want him leaning forward too much.

05:45.400 --> 05:54.400
His hands don't need to be that far out and his feet could be a little bit more out toward the shoulders

05:54.400 --> 05:55.370
a bit I think.

05:57.180 --> 06:01.480
And I'll move these knees out of hair like that

06:04.730 --> 06:15.000
and I'll bring these in as and rotate them a bit and I'm just hitting G and moving them around a bit

06:16.220 --> 06:19.900
and now I need to counter key that hand as you recall.

06:20.030 --> 06:22.820
So I'll just bring that out like that.

06:22.820 --> 06:25.920
Maybe a move that head forward a little bit.

06:25.920 --> 06:33.470
I'm in the middle mouse button click and drag over here and I can see that my transformation orientation

06:33.470 --> 06:40.290
is in global I'm going to change that to local and switch to rotation here.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.640
Something like this.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.920
Is it a little bit more angry maybe maybe move the elbows out just a hair.

06:50.930 --> 06:52.350
See how that works.

06:54.450 --> 07:00.360
And maybe I'll also make his feet not quite as in line with each other maybe move one back a little

07:00.360 --> 07:08.880
bit and move one forward just a hair and I could also even rotate these so they're out just a little

07:08.880 --> 07:13.020
bit like that something like that.

07:14.160 --> 07:19.830
So going to go ahead and key everything here at this key frame so select one and hit the key to select

07:19.830 --> 07:26.020
everything and once again I'm going to hit and key the location rotation and scale.

07:26.220 --> 07:31.400
I'm not going to do that every time but I'm going to go ahead and do that at the first frame here.

07:31.410 --> 07:31.680
All right.

07:31.680 --> 07:36.100
So now he's going to need to stand there and breathe a little bit.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.810
And I'm not sure exactly how long that's going to be.

07:39.810 --> 07:42.350
I'm going to begin with 12 frames now.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.470
We're working with 24 frames a second here.

07:45.510 --> 07:55.050
I think it's easier to calculate the fractions of a second in 24 frames a second but so for this frame

07:55.050 --> 08:01.690
let's kind of have that chest control kind of rotate back as if he's breathing a bit.

08:02.010 --> 08:09.260
Let's see what happens if I just rotate this back a bit you kind of breathes a little bit like that.

08:09.700 --> 08:12.420
So now if I go back you can see he's kind of

08:15.370 --> 08:28.290
breathing like that and maybe let's take that chest keyframe which is right here in the dope sheet and

08:28.300 --> 08:33.940
we can duplicate this and move it forward to say frame 24 Let's try that.

08:33.940 --> 08:42.040
I'm going to press shift D and move the mouse and I'm going to move this up to around frame 24 like

08:42.070 --> 08:44.990
that.

08:45.010 --> 08:46.980
Now let's hit play and see what happens.

08:51.370 --> 08:54.220
Seems like a little bit too quick.

08:54.220 --> 08:56.720
I'm just trying to find the timing here.

08:57.040 --> 09:04.570
So if I select that keyframe on the dope sheet for the chest and also shift select this one and hit

09:04.570 --> 09:13.610
the G key and move these forward a bit maybe I'll go to 20 and 40 Let's go in and try that.

09:15.380 --> 09:18.030
And we go back to the beginning and hit play

09:22.330 --> 09:23.970
that feels a little better to me.

09:23.980 --> 09:31.210
And I'm also watching over here I've got this particular screen set up behind him as if we're seeing

09:31.210 --> 09:33.070
him in the game.

09:33.070 --> 09:34.970
All right let's try that.

09:35.140 --> 09:38.770
I could even I could even go a little bit further couldn't I.

09:38.770 --> 09:39.580
Let me try that.

09:39.580 --> 09:48.910
I'm going to go to frame sixty four for the range of my animation here.

09:48.940 --> 09:52.360
And so now let me zoom out a bit here.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.800
So now let's take these.

09:53.800 --> 10:00.000
I'm going to take this one and this one and I'm going to move it forward to about 30.

10:00.230 --> 10:03.980
And this one forward to about 60.

10:04.110 --> 10:06.560
Let's see what happens here just the timing of it.

10:12.790 --> 10:15.120
I don't know that feels a little better to me.

10:15.130 --> 10:18.080
What do you think.

10:18.090 --> 10:21.740
Let's give it a try in the next video.

10:21.750 --> 10:26.510
We'll continue with the idle animation and we'll talk more about the graph editor in tangents.
