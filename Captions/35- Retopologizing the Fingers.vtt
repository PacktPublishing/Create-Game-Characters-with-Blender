00:00.770 --> 00:03.250
Well today I'd like to work on the fingers.

00:03.590 --> 00:11.240
As I mentioned before I'm going to have these be separate pieces or a separate piece from the rest of

00:11.240 --> 00:12.530
the character.

00:13.610 --> 00:20.180
But I am going to begin with a cylinder like I have for the arms and legs so first of all what I'm going

00:20.180 --> 00:29.900
to do is tab into edit mode for the body and just select an edge here and then I'm going to press shift.

00:29.950 --> 00:30.410
Yes.

00:30.440 --> 00:39.110
And I'm going to move the cursor to the selected edges here and now I'm going to tab back into object

00:39.110 --> 00:39.950
mode.

00:40.010 --> 00:46.310
Now when I create a cylinder it will pop into the location where the 3D cursor is.

00:46.310 --> 00:55.670
So I'll come over here to the Create tab and click on cylinder and for this I think I only need 8 sides

00:55.790 --> 00:58.550
for this particular object.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.870
I'll turn off the cap.

01:00.890 --> 01:04.430
Phil I don't need anything on the ends.

01:04.430 --> 01:13.700
And now let me rotate in scale etc. this thing and tell it's about where we need it on the finger.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.470
So I'm going to scale it down.

01:16.330 --> 01:22.360
Rotate it a bit and just try and get it as well as I can.

01:22.410 --> 01:26.970
So it's fitting around this object or this finger.

01:26.970 --> 01:30.930
I'm going to switch to local transform orientation.

01:31.110 --> 01:39.240
Just so when I go to the scale to it I can scale it in the length of the object there and I'll just

01:39.240 --> 01:45.870
start rotating and moving it until I can get it right around that finger.

01:45.910 --> 01:53.170
Now I think also I will tab into edit mode and add a few more cross sections here by pressing control

01:53.230 --> 02:00.530
r and scrolling the mouse wheel and I'm going to need quite a few for this actually.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.710
I'm going to give myself six edges.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.680
Let's try that.

02:05.680 --> 02:14.500
And I would also like to rotate this or I should say bend this at the joint here so it fits around the

02:14.500 --> 02:16.020
finger a little better.

02:16.270 --> 02:25.330
So I'm going to select this edge and then press control plus and expand the selection up to say here

02:26.410 --> 02:35.020
and then I'll go ahead and move the pivot point of this rotation to the 3D cursor and I'll go to the

02:35.020 --> 02:41.930
rotate tool and I'll just rotate this down a bit like this and then we go.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.210
All right let's give this a try now.

02:44.270 --> 02:47.360
I'm going to tab back into object mode.

02:47.480 --> 02:55.780
I will go to the modifiers panel click add modifier and let's add the shrinkwrapped modifier.

02:56.120 --> 03:01.040
And now for my target I'll just choose character because that's the character object.

03:01.460 --> 03:03.590
And let's see how that works.

03:04.010 --> 03:05.030
It's working pretty well.

03:05.030 --> 03:10.720
There's some problems here you can see it's trying to pick up the other finger.

03:10.940 --> 03:16.200
And that's the difficulty with something so close to another object there.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.840
Let me try and move this just a hair.

03:19.100 --> 03:26.210
So all I'm doing is just moving this in Object mode and you can see as I do it will pick up or move

03:26.210 --> 03:30.100
off of that other finger so I'm just going to go with that.

03:30.110 --> 03:36.890
I think right about there and then I'm going to come over here to the object panel and turn on x ray

03:36.890 --> 03:39.380
Let's see what it looks like.

03:39.380 --> 03:42.320
All right that's looking pretty good.

03:42.320 --> 03:47.370
What I need to make sure of too is that there are edges at the joints.

03:47.480 --> 03:55.130
So if I turn off x ray here and go into edit mode while the shrinkwrapped modifier is still on we can

03:55.130 --> 03:59.300
take a look at the edges and where they're placed.

03:59.300 --> 04:03.120
So this edge is placed pretty much on that joint.

04:03.140 --> 04:04.160
That's good.

04:04.400 --> 04:08.640
And this edge right here is placed pretty much on that joint.

04:09.020 --> 04:09.820
So that's pretty good.

04:09.830 --> 04:12.140
I think that will work.

04:12.290 --> 04:19.450
So I'll tab back into object mode go back to the modifiers panel and just click apply.

04:19.640 --> 04:20.670
And there we go.

04:20.810 --> 04:25.050
Now that modifier is baked permanently into the object.

04:25.550 --> 04:33.170
It looks like I could move these points down a bit so I may do a little bit of work just moving points

04:33.170 --> 04:34.510
around.

04:34.670 --> 04:38.410
I think I'd better turn on the snap tool.

04:38.530 --> 04:39.670
I'll do that.

04:39.670 --> 04:44.180
And now as I move things around they should snap to the object.

04:44.400 --> 04:44.930
So

04:47.700 --> 04:52.730
and I'm just moving these to get them in line with that joint.

04:53.450 --> 04:55.550
And this one up here looks pretty good.

04:55.610 --> 05:05.210
I think I might move this down a bit and I can slide this edge down by pressing G twice I'll hit G two

05:05.210 --> 05:08.300
times and now it'll slide along that edge.

05:08.410 --> 05:15.910
I can move these down to about here and do that and move this joint up a little bit.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.800
And I what I want is three edges for every joint.

05:20.810 --> 05:30.170
So if this joint is going to bend here I've got an edge on either side to help hold the shape of the

05:30.170 --> 05:31.990
mesh when it bends.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.280
So maybe I'll add one right in here as well.

05:35.430 --> 05:36.360
Like that.

05:36.740 --> 05:44.810
I'll turn the pivot point back to medium point and if I like this I wonder if I can rotate it a bit

05:44.960 --> 05:52.840
and we go and slide it around some and we go so now let me turn on x ray and let's take a look at that.

05:53.360 --> 06:00.230
Yes so we've got the bend happening in the finger here and the bend happening here.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.900
I think that'll worked out alright.

06:06.270 --> 06:11.680
Let's now think about that fingernail what are we going to do with this.

06:12.380 --> 06:19.040
Well I think what I want to try is selecting this edge right here on the top of the fingernail.

06:19.250 --> 06:24.430
And I'd like to extrude this down so I'm just going to hit me and pull down here.

06:25.370 --> 06:27.890
And I want to snap these two.

06:27.890 --> 06:29.310
The fingernail.

06:29.650 --> 06:37.340
Actually I'm a turn off x ray for just a moment and try and move these with the G key so they snap to

06:37.340 --> 06:38.150
the fingernail

06:42.230 --> 06:44.360
I'd like to extrude them one more time.

06:44.460 --> 06:51.160
Now we pull these down a bit and right down to the tip of that fingernail.

06:51.170 --> 06:57.300
And I will snap these.

06:57.560 --> 07:06.110
Now what I'm going to need to do is extrude these to give it thickness on the back because if we see

07:06.110 --> 07:12.710
it from the back we don't want to see through the back of the polygons and then are connected up with

07:12.710 --> 07:14.740
these edges here.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.030
So let's try that.

07:17.030 --> 07:20.360
I will select these points here.

07:22.250 --> 07:28.800
Extrude and pull down a bit and then I just need to connect these up now.

07:29.030 --> 07:32.660
So I'll take it easy and pull them back.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.770
This should come over here.

07:35.810 --> 07:38.150
This should come over here.

07:39.510 --> 07:42.060
And then we can begin hooking these up.

07:42.060 --> 07:55.710
So these four points can be a face and these four points can be a face like so and now I want to select

07:56.610 --> 07:58.930
these points around here.

08:01.630 --> 08:12.690
And extrude these down to the tip of the finger like that and will then connect these up to the fingernail

08:12.700 --> 08:15.820
let me turn this off real quick and snap these

08:22.340 --> 08:31.840
I will connect these up and extrude and pull these out and snap these to these points with Allt.

08:31.870 --> 08:33.680
And then at last

08:36.630 --> 08:45.620
and then finally connect these up so I'm going to hit this point this point this one and this one and

08:45.620 --> 08:51.650
connect it and then do the same with this over here.

08:51.650 --> 08:56.790
And then you can see I've got some interesting work to do here.

08:58.030 --> 09:02.480
What I'll do for this is just insert one edge loop here.

09:04.760 --> 09:08.940
And then connect these up like so

09:12.890 --> 09:14.050
there we go.

09:15.950 --> 09:17.530
And do the same thing over here.

09:22.070 --> 09:24.900
So that gives us a good beginning to the finger.

09:24.920 --> 09:31.310
Now I will probably go ahead and add a cylinder for each one of these and do a similar thing.

09:31.430 --> 09:40.670
You could also duplicate this duplicate this object and move it over and scale it to fit each of the

09:40.670 --> 09:41.900
fingers.

09:42.020 --> 09:49.120
But I think I will go ahead and add each cylinder so they fit kind of exactly to the model.

09:49.400 --> 09:56.000
And in the next video we'll work on connecting all the fingers up and extruding them back into the glove.
