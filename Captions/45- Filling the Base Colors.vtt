00:00.610 --> 00:06.560
Well in the last video we took a look at setting up the scene for texture painting.

00:06.580 --> 00:12.520
Now what I like to do is just begin establishing the base colors of the textures.

00:12.520 --> 00:16.270
So to do that I'm going to use this little guy right down here.

00:16.320 --> 00:21.220
This is the face selection masking for painting.

00:21.220 --> 00:31.160
So what we can do is turn this on and you can see we've got now the wireframe of the mesh.

00:31.330 --> 00:39.130
And if I press the A key it will select all of the polygons if I hit the A key again it'll de-select

00:39.140 --> 00:39.810
them.

00:39.850 --> 00:49.390
I can also click and select individual polygons I can hold the shift key down and select multiple polygons

00:49.870 --> 00:57.660
so we can use this to begin selecting the areas I would like to lay down a base color on.

00:57.670 --> 01:03.400
Now the nice thing about it is it actually masks out areas you do not want to paint on.

01:03.400 --> 01:14.650
So if I had these faces selected and went to my Tools tab and changed my color lets say I changed my

01:14.650 --> 01:21.010
color to some sort of white ish here and I came over and I began painting.

01:21.070 --> 01:29.470
You can see that as I go off those selected polygons it will not paint on those so that will allow us

01:29.470 --> 01:32.090
to use the fill brush.

01:32.140 --> 01:38.830
We're going to hit the A key to de-select these will be able to come over here and use the fill brush

01:38.950 --> 01:43.840
to fill selected areas with a base color.

01:43.840 --> 01:50.170
Now if you do not have a fill brush in your selection here in your paint brush selection all you really

01:50.170 --> 01:56.740
need to do is create a new brush with the plus icon here and then all you have to do once you've created

01:56.740 --> 02:04.360
that brush and have it selected you just come down here to the brush menu go to image paint tools and

02:04.360 --> 02:10.220
change your brush type from whatever it is to fill.

02:10.270 --> 02:17.170
So sometimes the fill brush doesn't appear here so you can just create a new one and switch it to the

02:17.170 --> 02:17.860
fill.

02:17.860 --> 02:25.690
All right so I'm going to change my brush to the fill brush and I'm going to give myself a nice greenish

02:25.690 --> 02:31.510
color here because he's a Green Goblin of some sort and the colors don't have to be perfect here but

02:31.510 --> 02:35.740
I just want to get the general colors laid down.

02:35.740 --> 02:40.640
So for this now let me begin here on the torso.

02:40.710 --> 02:48.210
I'm going to hover over this area and press the L key and what that will do is select that area based

02:48.210 --> 02:54.210
on the seams that you created long ago for U-V mapping.

02:54.270 --> 02:54.570
Right.

02:54.570 --> 03:01.800
So if I hover over the head here and press the L key you can see that it's just selecting the areas

03:02.130 --> 03:09.000
within the seams and I'll hover over the ears and press the key as well.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.110
And now I can just with Phil brush selected and this color selected I'm going to turn my strength up

03:16.110 --> 03:16.950
all the way.

03:17.190 --> 03:25.980
I can just come over here and click and it'll fill that color or fill that area with my selected color

03:26.010 --> 03:31.810
and you can see that it will fill it over here on the U-V map as well.

03:31.810 --> 03:36.470
Now I'm going to make that color just a little bit darker about that.

03:36.840 --> 03:37.220
Yeah.

03:37.230 --> 03:40.300
Get in there about that.

03:40.470 --> 03:40.790
Yeah.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.700
Why not.

03:42.900 --> 03:47.590
We'll add some more detail and texture to that as we go.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.530
But that's looking OK.

03:50.550 --> 03:55.860
All right so when you press the H key to de-select that area and then hover over this part and press

03:55.860 --> 04:04.880
the L key and then I think just click here and I will go.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.020
Same thing with the fingers.

04:07.040 --> 04:16.190
It is a key to de-select and then hit the L key to select all the fingers and click and I'll come over

04:16.190 --> 04:19.290
here and hit the A key.

04:19.400 --> 04:23.050
Select the legs and click there as well.

04:23.360 --> 04:29.230
OK so now we've laid down the base color for the skin.

04:29.240 --> 04:32.990
Let's do the same thing for the leather items.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.150
We're going to need a brown for this.

04:35.150 --> 04:43.370
I'm just going to swing over here to the brownish area and make it a little bit darker maybe something

04:43.370 --> 04:44.420
like that.

04:44.510 --> 04:50.630
And once again these are not final colors I'm just laying down a base so I'm not painting directly on

04:50.630 --> 04:59.390
the black here so I'll hit the A key to de-select everything and then hover over these arm bands and

04:59.390 --> 05:08.760
press Al probably the boots and the little rim there on the boots I bet I'll need to come down here

05:08.760 --> 05:11.410
and get the soles of the boots sure enough.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.820
I'll just click here.

05:14.060 --> 05:19.130
Let's now work on the little Toga thing.

05:19.220 --> 05:24.010
This I think I want to be a little bit lighter a little bit.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.440
Beige maybe something like this.

05:29.860 --> 05:30.830
Presti.

05:31.570 --> 05:33.130
For all of these pieces

05:36.270 --> 05:44.370
and click and then the buckles and the shoulder armor I was thinking silver for these.

05:44.550 --> 05:52.660
Well let's try that I'll select a black and then I'll bring up the slider to make it kind of a gray

05:52.660 --> 05:55.100
silver ish thing.

05:55.420 --> 06:00.980
We go and hover over these and press the L key.

06:00.990 --> 06:02.640
Now it looks like yeah.

06:02.650 --> 06:10.960
When I did that there must be a seam there so all hover over that with the L key there as well.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.390
And the shoulder pad here.

06:16.420 --> 06:20.190
I'll try and fill all this with the L key.

06:20.220 --> 06:20.770
All right.

06:20.770 --> 06:25.800
And I'll click and maybe that should be a little bit darker.

06:26.020 --> 06:27.290
Let's try that.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.870
Something like that maybe even a little darker Why not.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.090
And we go.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.340
All right.

06:37.650 --> 06:41.730
So now I can come down here and turn off the face selection.

06:42.730 --> 06:45.820
And then we have the base colors of our character.

06:45.820 --> 06:49.130
Now we need to do two things here.

06:49.150 --> 06:54.970
One is to save our scenes so limited press control or command s to save our scene.

06:55.060 --> 07:03.080
But also I need to come over here and press alt s to save this scene or to save this image.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.520
I should say so.

07:04.660 --> 07:05.340
Yes.

07:05.650 --> 07:13.060
And that saves the image because remember that is a completely other entity a completely other file

07:13.060 --> 07:17.050
on our drive from our blender seen file.

07:17.050 --> 07:19.780
Now looks like I missed something right down here.

07:19.780 --> 07:20.710
Sure enough.

07:20.740 --> 07:24.630
Let me just turn this on real quick and grab these.

07:24.910 --> 07:32.210
Now this is a good time to ask how do I get that the same color how do I sample that color.

07:32.500 --> 07:40.480
Well if we come over here to the U-V editor part and we make sure that this is change the mode is set

07:40.480 --> 07:41.650
to paint.

07:41.980 --> 07:47.630
We can then come in here to any color hold the key down.

07:47.740 --> 07:55.410
We get an eye dropper and then we click and that will create a little pallet right here for that color.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.690
So now I can choose that palette.

07:57.940 --> 08:03.480
And we're back to the same color and now we can fill this with the fill brush.

08:03.650 --> 08:12.940
And here we go so that's an easy way to sample colors off of your U-V map here we'll also be using that

08:12.940 --> 08:19.600
technique to sample colors off of images we find on say Google Images or something like that.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.680
OK so we've got our base colors laid down.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.500
We haven't done the ice yet.

08:25.540 --> 08:26.110
That's OK.

08:26.110 --> 08:28.630
We'll work on that here pretty soon.

08:28.630 --> 08:31.720
I'm going to turn that face masking off.

08:31.990 --> 08:33.230
Saved my scene.

08:34.300 --> 08:40.470
And if I hold the middle mouse button and drag back over here I can see that we still have an asterix

08:40.470 --> 08:44.430
here so many hit alt s to save that image.

08:44.430 --> 08:50.070
Now I talked last time about how are we going to be able to see where we're painting where we should

08:50.070 --> 08:58.770
be painting to get details like if I come back over here to the high poly object and I get out of texture

08:58.800 --> 09:04.950
viewport shading for a minute here I'll just switch over to solid and maybe a better switch over to

09:04.950 --> 09:08.460
object mode as well.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.840
There we go.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.230
You can see that we've got these straps here.

09:13.260 --> 09:18.230
How am I going to see where these should be on the model.

09:19.380 --> 09:23.330
Over here how am I going to know where to paint.

09:23.700 --> 09:30.600
Well what we can do let me go back to when we select the object and I'm back to texture paint.

09:30.630 --> 09:40.410
Now what we can do is we can use our paint slots right here to bring in the normal map so we can see

09:40.440 --> 09:44.120
where the high resolution sculpting was.

09:44.160 --> 09:51.570
So I'll hit the add texture paint slot right here and I'll come over to normal because we're going to

09:51.570 --> 09:57.780
bring in a normal map and maybe I'll change the name to normal map.

09:58.020 --> 10:02.490
And I think we've been working with 2048 haven't we.

10:02.490 --> 10:13.070
And we go and I click OK now we need to go find the image to put in our normal map.

10:13.170 --> 10:21.720
So if we come over here now and selected that texture layer we can scroll down here go to the image

10:21.780 --> 10:23.550
section.

10:23.730 --> 10:28.760
Click on open and now I just need to find that normal map.

10:28.790 --> 10:34.590
Here we go I think this is it and click open.

10:34.770 --> 10:39.130
Now we've added the image to the slot.

10:39.150 --> 10:40.550
Here it is here.

10:40.830 --> 10:43.840
And if we switch over to it we can see it here.

10:43.890 --> 10:52.800
There's our normal map and now we can see those strips on the arm bands but we can't see the color through

10:52.800 --> 10:53.420
there.

10:53.430 --> 10:59.600
One of the things I need to do is just switch back to texture view in my viewport and there we go.

10:59.600 --> 11:06.740
So now we can see both the color and the normal map in our 3D view.

11:07.110 --> 11:14.820
So as we paint we can see where we're supposed to paint we can see where the wrinkles on the fingers

11:14.820 --> 11:21.570
are or the strips on the gloves or even a bit of the muscle definition.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.280
Even the ears a bit.

11:23.280 --> 11:32.070
Now this isn't perfect This isn't beautiful this is just a a temporary thing as we paint but it allows

11:32.070 --> 11:35.970
us to get a good sense of where the paint should go down.

11:35.970 --> 11:44.940
So we'll be using this normal map to help us paint the detail for our high resolution sculpt in the

11:44.940 --> 11:51.960
next video we'll take a look at adding more texture slots so we can build up layers of paint on the

11:51.960 --> 11:52.780
character.
