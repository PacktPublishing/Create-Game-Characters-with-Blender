00:01.210 --> 00:07.930
Now the next thing I'd like to do is to get ready for making the run cycle and for this character I'm

00:07.930 --> 00:16.600
just going to do a standard 13 frame run cycle once again I'm animating at 24 frames a second but my

00:16.690 --> 00:25.570
run cycle will take place over 13 frames and each of the frames within that run cycle will have a particular

00:25.810 --> 00:34.350
position like frame 1 will be a contact position frame for will be the passing position.

00:34.450 --> 00:41.850
Frame five will be the up position so I'll need to know exactly and easily which frame is which.

00:42.010 --> 00:50.030
Now I currently have all of my key frames happening between zero or between 1 and 60.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.760
What I need to do is move them.

00:52.810 --> 01:00.850
I want to be able to use the 1 through 13 frames but my previous animation cycle is in the way so I

01:00.850 --> 01:02.500
need to move them.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.310
What I'm going to do is use the dope sheet.

01:05.320 --> 01:08.810
I think that's usually about the easiest way to do it.

01:08.860 --> 01:15.550
So if I zoom in up here I can see that appear on the summary row I've got all of my key frames so I

01:15.550 --> 01:17.470
can select this.

01:17.920 --> 01:24.820
And these here and that will go ahead and select everything down below here.

01:25.730 --> 01:29.920
Now I didn't grab my default pose that frames zero.

01:29.930 --> 01:32.030
I'm going to keep that there for now.

01:32.030 --> 01:37.900
So I only need 13 frames down here maybe I'll move my idol to frame 20.

01:38.060 --> 01:39.210
Let's try that.

01:40.180 --> 01:47.770
So I'll just press the G key and move until I get up to frame 20 and click.

01:47.770 --> 01:48.880
And there we go.

01:49.270 --> 01:53.760
So now I've got this space free to do my run cycle.

01:53.830 --> 02:04.060
But if I zoom in here you can see that between frame 0 and frame 20 I've got a lot happening in the

02:04.060 --> 02:04.630
curves here.

02:04.630 --> 02:05.880
I don't want that.

02:05.980 --> 02:07.840
I don't want all that happening.

02:07.960 --> 02:15.970
So I can take that default pose at frame zero duplicate that zoom in a bit here.

02:17.280 --> 02:23.090
Shift the and I'll move that up to frame 19.

02:23.190 --> 02:24.650
As we go.

02:24.650 --> 02:34.450
So now I've got a nice clear path in here from 1 to 13 and I've got my default pose holding that until

02:34.610 --> 02:37.870
just before I need it at frame 20.

02:37.880 --> 02:45.290
So to test this I can always go down here to the start frame and type in 20 and looks like I probably

02:45.290 --> 02:47.240
go to 80 one I think.

02:47.690 --> 02:49.750
Let's try that.

02:49.780 --> 02:50.710
Here it is.

02:51.010 --> 02:56.320
And we hit if we go back to the beginning of this and hit play

02:59.430 --> 03:01.220
we have a bit of a pop.

03:01.230 --> 03:06.120
Looks like I've got my frames a little off let me type in 22 and see what happens here.

03:09.730 --> 03:10.670
And there we go.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.390
So I have I have it from 22 to 81 here.

03:14.420 --> 03:16.840
All right that'll work.

03:16.850 --> 03:25.880
So now I need to go back to 1 through 13 so I'll type in one for the start 13 for the end and let's

03:25.880 --> 03:28.830
go over here and zoom in for that.

03:29.390 --> 03:30.430
And there it is.

03:30.830 --> 03:34.150
And I'll go back to frame 1 there.

03:34.220 --> 03:41.280
Now we have our range in which our run cycle is going to take place.

03:41.300 --> 03:44.600
All right so let's start working on the legs.

03:44.600 --> 03:51.470
Well let's try and figure out what our positions are going to be for each frame.

03:51.510 --> 04:00.060
Now for free and one in frame 7 I'm going to want a contact IPO's and what I mean by that is the place

04:00.060 --> 04:05.990
where the heel of the character contacts the ground as he comes back down from the up position.

04:06.270 --> 04:16.430
So to begin with I think I'm going to take these hands and the torso Here let me turn on the manipulators

04:16.430 --> 04:17.170
again.

04:17.540 --> 04:24.500
I'm going to go to the movie tool and in local transformation my manipulators are a little bit out of

04:24.560 --> 04:25.750
alignment with the world.

04:25.760 --> 04:30.510
I'll go back to Global For now just as I move these things around.

04:30.710 --> 04:36.260
I'm going to move him down at frame 1 just a bit.

04:36.750 --> 04:43.170
So that will automatically create a keyframe because I've got autokey turned on down here.

04:43.260 --> 04:45.090
I think I'll go to my side.

04:45.090 --> 04:52.350
Orthographic view here and maybe I'll rotate him forward just a bit like that so he's kind of leaning

04:52.350 --> 04:54.450
into the run.

04:54.510 --> 04:57.930
I'll take this foot here and move it forward.

04:58.230 --> 05:04.620
And this is the foot that I think I want him to contact the ground with and I'll rotate that back just

05:04.680 --> 05:13.580
a little bit for the heel to hit like that I think I need this one to come up like this.

05:14.750 --> 05:23.850
And maybe like this I'll go ahead and bring this down just to bed I'll grab the hands to just to keep

05:23.850 --> 05:25.590
him in line for now.

05:26.450 --> 05:32.440
And this torso bring that down a bit.

05:32.530 --> 05:40.490
Now I can get that foot contact the ground I think something like that and I'm going to try and stay

05:40.490 --> 05:49.790
in line with this Z-axis as I as I go try not to bring him forward or back too much and maybe I'll bring

05:49.790 --> 05:51.550
this leg back just a hair.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.480
I don't like that.

05:53.480 --> 06:00.180
So there's frame one that same thing is going to need to happen at frame 13.

06:00.200 --> 06:05.480
So I'll grab this key frame right up here that will select everything below it.

06:05.480 --> 06:11.010
Duplicate it with shift D and then move it over to frame 13.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.530
And there we go.

06:12.530 --> 06:18.040
So now if I play it it should just hold it throughout that whole cycle.

06:18.070 --> 06:18.980
All right.

06:19.120 --> 06:27.590
Now we need to have that same pose at frame 7 but flipped so the feet are reversed.

06:27.910 --> 06:35.350
Let's come over here to frame seven and I'm going to select everything with the achy all the bones.

06:35.350 --> 06:36.950
And now I can come down here.

06:37.120 --> 06:43.180
Middle mouse button drag to this menu bar over here because I don't have much screen real estate to

06:43.180 --> 06:43.650
work with.

06:43.660 --> 06:51.030
But if I scroll over here and I select this copy copy the current PPOs I can copy those.

06:51.070 --> 06:54.520
And now if I paste here it will flip those.

06:54.520 --> 07:01.210
So everything is reversed so the legs are reversed so if I click this now you can see the legs have

07:01.210 --> 07:09.640
been reversed so if I hit play we get the beginnings of a run cycle.

07:09.640 --> 07:15.730
So now we have our two contact positions at frames 1 and 7.

07:15.730 --> 07:19.060
Let's now work on the passing position at frame for.
