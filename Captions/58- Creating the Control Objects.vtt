WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:05.360
Well I've got the joints set up here to match the character.

00:05.870 --> 00:12.920
And now what we need to do is generate the actual rig with the control objects so I'll go ahead and

00:12.920 --> 00:23.120
select the rig and I'll come over here to the armature panel and I'll scroll all the way down and right

00:23.120 --> 00:25.760
here let's click on generate

00:28.410 --> 00:29.680
and there we go.

00:29.700 --> 00:37.080
Now we've got a rig with all its hierarchy's and parenting as well as all the control objects based

00:37.080 --> 00:40.860
on the rig that we modified to the character.

00:40.890 --> 00:45.180
Now the rig we modified is called Mehta rig.

00:45.180 --> 00:48.980
So I can go ahead and hide that by clicking on the eyeball.

00:49.050 --> 00:54.450
And here is the actual rig now I'll press Z and you can kind of tell.

00:54.450 --> 01:02.670
You can kind of see what's going on in here these ball controls here are the stretchy controls so those

01:02.760 --> 01:08.770
allow you to stretch the limbs and you've got f k and I.K. controls in here as well.

01:08.780 --> 01:16.790
But here let's go ahead and bind the character to the rig so we can see how it moves around.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.110
So what I'll do is I'll go ahead and select the character.

01:20.250 --> 01:27.780
And in addition I'm going to select the eyes because I want to bind the eyes to the rig as well since

01:27.780 --> 01:30.360
those are separate objects.

01:30.360 --> 01:38.430
So I'll select all of those and then I'll press shift and click one of the controls of the rig now to

01:38.520 --> 01:42.360
bind the character to the rig we just need to parent it.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.210
So when you press control p.

01:44.460 --> 01:53.850
And now we've got the set parent menu and I want to set parent to the armature form with automatic weights.

01:53.880 --> 02:01.080
So if I click this it doesn't really appear that anything's happened however if we select one of the

02:01.080 --> 02:06.660
controls and switch it from object mode to pose mode.

02:06.770 --> 02:16.450
Now I'm going to press our twice to rotate and now you can see we've got the head down to the rig and

02:16.540 --> 02:19.050
it's really a pretty good bind.

02:19.090 --> 02:21.440
It even got all of the ears.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.740
So I mean that's pretty good.

02:23.800 --> 02:28.630
I'm going to press the N key to bring up the properties panel over here and if I scroll all the way

02:28.630 --> 02:33.610
down we can see we've got these rig Lehre buttons.

02:33.610 --> 02:41.190
And what I want for this character is I want both the legs and the arms to be inverse kinematics.

02:41.350 --> 02:49.170
In the last series I did we set up I.K. for the legs but we used forward kinematics for the arms.

02:49.180 --> 02:53.150
So what do I mean by I.K. and FKO just real quick.

02:53.560 --> 02:58.790
Let me turn the metric back on just to talk about this for a minute forward.

02:58.830 --> 03:06.550
Kinematics means that the rotations are happening on a chain forward down the hierarchy.

03:06.580 --> 03:14.140
So if I wanted to move this leg let me turn this off for once once again and I'm going to take this

03:14.620 --> 03:21.850
and go to the rotate tool so forward kinematics would be I would rotate the leg like this.

03:21.910 --> 03:27.130
And then I'd maybe like this part of the leg and rotate the leg like this.

03:27.130 --> 03:33.150
So I'm moving the leg by going forward down the chain.

03:33.150 --> 03:38.350
All right let me undo these now for inverse kinematics.

03:38.350 --> 03:44.450
What that allows you to do is select a control down here at the base of the chain.

03:44.560 --> 03:50.860
And as you move it the rotations or the control happens inversely up the limb.

03:50.860 --> 03:59.980
So if I selected this this foot I.K. I should be able to hit the key and move the leg around.

04:00.010 --> 04:01.650
But I can't.

04:01.660 --> 04:05.100
Let me show you what I mean if I hit the G key.

04:05.110 --> 04:06.850
It doesn't do anything.

04:06.850 --> 04:13.190
So what we need to do since I don't want to use f k for the arms or the legs.

04:13.390 --> 04:23.680
I'm going to turn off f k over here the arm L and the arm are and I'm a turn off f k for leg and leg

04:23.710 --> 04:24.470
are.

04:24.760 --> 04:32.680
Now that I've done that and I've got this foot I.K. selected I'm going to drag this slider the influence

04:32.680 --> 04:35.640
here from f k over to I.K..

04:35.860 --> 04:42.460
Now if I hit the G key and move it around you can see I can move the leg and even stretch it way out

04:42.460 --> 04:44.260
like that.

04:44.270 --> 04:51.450
All right so let me do that for this other leg over here like that slide that over I'm going to select

04:51.450 --> 04:59.730
the hand I k now while I'm here actually I can't see this control through the character.

04:59.730 --> 05:06.900
So what I can do is come over to the object panel and choose x ray and now I can see all of the control

05:06.900 --> 05:08.590
objects through the character.

05:08.730 --> 05:14.640
So I'll take the f k like a slider and drag it over and I'll do the same over here.

05:15.310 --> 05:22.370
So now we should be able to grab that control and hit G and move the arm around.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.380
And that looks pretty good.

05:24.380 --> 05:25.970
Same thing over here.

05:26.030 --> 05:28.320
Grab that control and move it around.

05:28.430 --> 05:28.980
Yeah.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.590
And we can even rotate it here as well.

05:35.570 --> 05:40.990
And in addition we've got our I.K. controls for the legs.

05:41.030 --> 05:48.900
Now I can grab this torso control and now I can move it down and he can kind of do the squats.

05:49.080 --> 05:54.740
So that's how we can set up the iCade chains for the character's arms and legs.

05:54.750 --> 06:02.760
Now all of these pieces here you can see if you select one these are kind of stretchy controls and I

06:02.760 --> 06:06.520
don't think I'm going to be using those much if at all.

06:06.570 --> 06:12.630
And in fact I think I'd like to hide them so I can come back over here and go to the armature panel

06:13.050 --> 06:14.630
and scroll up a bit.

06:14.820 --> 06:22.140
And these controls are on these different layers here so if I select this one I can see that it's on

06:22.140 --> 06:22.920
this layer.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.620
So all shift select that one to hide those.

06:26.700 --> 06:31.640
Maybe I'll select this one and I can see that that's that layer shift click that one.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.100
So like this one.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.960
And that's the layer here.

06:36.040 --> 06:43.090
And I'll select this one and it looks like that's the layer over here so I can hide those controls so

06:43.090 --> 06:48.520
they won't be in my way because I don't think I'm going to be using any of the stretchy functionality

06:48.550 --> 06:50.100
for the rig.

06:50.470 --> 06:53.010
So quickly the way these controls work.

06:53.020 --> 06:54.790
We already tested the head.

06:54.790 --> 07:02.470
I can press the our key twice and it kind of gives you a free rotate which is kind of nice for the head

07:03.250 --> 07:08.980
and for the neck here you can rotate it back and forth like this.

07:08.980 --> 07:18.120
Now you can see that the jaw is kind of coming along with the rotation of the neck here.

07:18.370 --> 07:23.980
So we're going to need to work on the weights for that.

07:23.980 --> 07:25.820
So keep that in mind.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.950
Let's test this one here.

07:27.970 --> 07:33.850
I'm going to hit R and rotate that so you can see that the shoulder and that looks pretty good.

07:33.850 --> 07:41.530
We can rotate it forward and back this control here is your torso or they call it the chest here.

07:41.540 --> 07:44.210
I'm going to hit our twice and rotate that around.

07:44.220 --> 07:46.180
You can see what that does.

07:46.270 --> 07:48.630
And this one here is the pelvis.

07:48.760 --> 07:56.530
And if I take this and move this box down a bit so he can squat you can see that he kind of does the

07:56.590 --> 07:57.860
hula dance there.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.830
Nice moves there guy.

07:59.830 --> 08:06.530
These controls back here are for the elbows and these here are for pointing the knees.

08:06.550 --> 08:16.870
So if you're using I.K. and you move say the arm around like this you may want to point this elbow in

08:16.960 --> 08:22.180
another direction say you want it to move down here or out like that.

08:22.180 --> 08:25.640
In terms of the hands these are pretty slick here.

08:25.750 --> 08:31.070
You can just select this control and hit s first scale.

08:31.240 --> 08:41.860
And as you scale it in the two joints at the end of the finger curl in this control right here controls

08:41.890 --> 08:47.800
the roll of that first joint and this control over here on this side.

08:47.800 --> 08:52.420
Let me just like that and I'll zoom in here.

08:52.420 --> 08:59.340
This control allows you to rotate and kind of splay the hand out a bit.

08:59.490 --> 09:04.740
Use adjust that Pinky as I mentioned.

09:04.750 --> 09:12.310
These are for the knee control or knee direction you can use those to point the knee where you need

09:12.310 --> 09:13.000
them to be.

09:13.000 --> 09:22.950
So if I moved this leg up like this let's say and I wanted the need to point out more this way I could

09:22.950 --> 09:26.410
do that for the feet.

09:26.420 --> 09:35.600
You've got the toe control right here that allows you to bend the toe up and down but you also have

09:35.600 --> 09:38.380
the foot roll control at the back.

09:38.510 --> 09:45.050
And this allows you to roll the foot up on the ball of the toes there and roll the foot back onto the

09:45.050 --> 09:51.330
heel so that's a nice foot roll rig that they've added for us here.

09:51.440 --> 09:58.310
And then finally the master control allows you to move the entire character and place it within the

09:58.310 --> 09:59.200
scene.

09:59.210 --> 10:07.690
Now I would not recommend if you have a character walking or moving or jumping through the scene.

10:07.700 --> 10:12.360
I would not recommend animating this control.

10:12.560 --> 10:19.610
This to me is really used to place the character in the scene at the beginning and then use the rest

10:19.610 --> 10:22.260
of the controls to move it around.

10:22.280 --> 10:28.070
Now as a game character will be doing just about all of our animation right here in the center of the

10:28.070 --> 10:29.030
grid.

10:29.060 --> 10:35.830
He'll be idling and running and jumping all here in place in the center of the grid.

10:35.990 --> 10:40.030
Will I have to admit I'm very impressed with the bind of the character here.

10:40.340 --> 10:48.680
I really liked the results but we still are going to have to do some work to tweak how certain parts

10:48.680 --> 10:51.550
of the character form like.

10:51.710 --> 10:59.710
I think this control here pulls the belt buckle out and in through the belt.

10:59.930 --> 11:02.200
So we're going to have to work on that.

11:02.450 --> 11:07.260
So there's some tweaking we're going to need to do to the weight to get it to look correct.

11:07.550 --> 11:10.310
So that's what we'll be working on in the next video.
