00:00.910 --> 00:07.360
We'll since the last video I've done a little work on the shoulder armor here you can see what I've

00:07.360 --> 00:14.860
done over here in the editor Ed. I'm going to press control up arrow and maximize that screen a bit

00:15.670 --> 00:22.450
so you can see I've just done some painting to try and emphasize the scope to detail on the shoulder

00:22.450 --> 00:23.370
piece there.

00:23.440 --> 00:32.140
Just try and give the normal map sculpted detail a little bit of extra pop kind of creating highlights

00:32.230 --> 00:35.530
and shadows for the designs.

00:35.530 --> 00:39.310
So what I've been doing is just coming in here.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.020
Let's see.

00:40.020 --> 00:42.040
I don't think I've done this one yet.

00:42.040 --> 00:46.580
Let me see yeah I haven't worked on this one yet.

00:46.580 --> 00:53.200
So what I've been doing is just coming in here going to my details slot here.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.920
Going back to the Tools tab.

00:55.360 --> 00:59.950
And I've got a light color here that I'll choose.

01:00.670 --> 01:04.450
And let me shrink the brush down a bit.

01:04.990 --> 01:11.620
So I'm just going to go over some of this detail here and you can see it kind of coming in as I paint

01:11.620 --> 01:21.220
on it and just lightly trying to emphasize the highlight and shadow of this piece or have the details

01:21.220 --> 01:21.770
on it.

01:22.570 --> 01:24.710
Just lightly going over it here.

01:26.090 --> 01:32.480
And then once I do that then I'll come back with a darker color.

01:33.550 --> 01:36.590
And emphasize the indentations or the shadows.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.670
Let me go back down here and reduce the spacing just a bit.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.020
See if that helps me some.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.420
Yeah I think that'll work.

01:45.430 --> 01:52.660
So I'm just going to come in here and try and catch these highlights and then I'll switch back to a

01:52.660 --> 01:54.600
darker color let's say.

01:54.850 --> 01:57.040
Let's try this.

01:57.040 --> 02:04.780
Or maybe even darker here I think and then I'll come in here and try and increase the shadows just a

02:04.780 --> 02:05.410
bit.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.960
I'll bring the strength back just a hair.

02:09.350 --> 02:09.890
There we go.

02:09.900 --> 02:12.170
So you can see that coming in over here.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.870
Now I've got another one over here I don't think I've worked on that one yet.

02:17.910 --> 02:20.020
Let me do this real quick.

02:22.130 --> 02:25.860
And once again I'll take the strength back just a hair again.

02:27.690 --> 02:34.420
And maybe reduce the jitter slightly and let me work on this here.

02:34.440 --> 02:42.080
I better change the color and we go and I think this will be coming in right over here

02:48.410 --> 02:50.960
yeah you can see it coming in right in here.

02:50.960 --> 02:51.250
Now

02:55.260 --> 03:01.920
now as I'm doing this you may notice that it's kind of hard to see actually on the model.

03:01.920 --> 03:10.200
What I'm doing here on the model itself and a lot of that is because of the specular highlights that

03:10.260 --> 03:17.970
the Hemi lights are imparting to the model and we can actually turn those off to get a sense of how

03:17.970 --> 03:23.500
we're doing while we're painting or after we paint just to see how we've done.

03:23.850 --> 03:24.230
All right.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.610
So I've got these laid down here.

03:29.220 --> 03:32.850
Let's take a look at the texturing without the specular highlights.

03:32.920 --> 03:39.120
So if I come over here to one of the Hemmy lights if I select that you can see I've got the option to

03:39.120 --> 03:47.700
have it emit both diffuse which is the color or the specular which is the shiny a..

03:47.730 --> 03:53.770
So if I turn that off you can see that some of that shining is goes away here.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.450
Let me turn that on and turn it off.

03:56.700 --> 04:03.030
And that's because I've got two Hemi lights in the scene here so I've got one here one here one kind

04:03.030 --> 04:07.450
of shining at an angle on the front and one on the back.

04:07.450 --> 04:11.500
And so currently I'm selecting this front one for the Hemmy up front.

04:11.700 --> 04:20.310
If we select the one in the back here and turn off the specular highlights you can really see what the

04:20.310 --> 04:22.870
texturing looks like now.

04:23.100 --> 04:30.900
So you can see what I've done with just this kind of splatter of color as well as going in and tracing

04:30.900 --> 04:35.530
the highlights and the shadows of the scope to detail.

04:35.970 --> 04:42.060
So any time you can always come over here and turn off the specular highlights for your hemi lights

04:42.450 --> 04:44.110
just to see how you're doing.

04:44.160 --> 04:50.270
Or sometimes I like to just have one on so maybe have this one on or turn this off.

04:51.250 --> 04:57.490
And this went on so you can get a different look on your model as you're painting.

04:57.490 --> 04:57.910
All right.

04:57.940 --> 05:01.740
Well I think that's pretty good for the armor.

05:01.900 --> 05:09.270
I'm going to turn the specular on in the back here like this just to take a look at that.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.450
I think that's looking pretty good for now.

05:11.640 --> 05:15.060
Let's go ahead and move on to another part of the model.

05:15.660 --> 05:22.020
I'm thinking that I kind of want to work on the little Toga here.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.410
We can always come back and work on the gloves and the boots.

05:25.410 --> 05:30.570
They're a similar kind of color as the leather straps that we've done.

05:31.020 --> 05:36.650
And if we're going to come back to that at some point we better save those colors or save that pallet.

05:36.810 --> 05:40.030
So I'm going to come back here and choose my low poly character.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.330
And now we're back into texture paint mode over here.

05:44.400 --> 05:53.050
So these colors here have really been used to work with the straps and the metal.

05:53.070 --> 06:01.410
And when I come back to the leather texture for the boots and the gloves I'm going to want to have access

06:01.410 --> 06:02.810
to these colors again.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.390
Yes I could sample them again off of the U-V map here but I think it'd be better if I could maintain

06:09.420 --> 06:11.060
this color palette.

06:11.130 --> 06:18.180
So what I want to do is come over here and I'm going to rename this pallet or call this like call it

06:18.180 --> 06:22.850
straps and metal and go.

06:22.960 --> 06:30.820
And now if I go to the next palette I have I'm going to click here and choose the next one.

06:30.820 --> 06:37.450
Now maybe this one I could call or call this one cloth.

06:37.510 --> 06:42.920
And this is the one that's going to have the color swatches for his clothes here.

06:43.090 --> 06:45.030
So I don't need these right now.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.240
These were just temporary.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.640
I want to delete these.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.530
There we go.

06:50.520 --> 06:56.860
So now I can work on building up color swatches for this palette so I can work on the cloth.

06:57.420 --> 07:01.320
But to do that I'm going to need reference images as you can tell.

07:01.320 --> 07:09.940
I do a lot of sampling off of photographs and real world images to help me get the colors more accurate.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.620
So what I need to go find a few reference images.

07:13.620 --> 07:19.740
But quickly before I do that I'm just going to go to the slots tab and be sure and click save all images

07:20.640 --> 07:23.420
so that I don't lose what I just did.

07:23.580 --> 07:31.560
If I exit out of Blender I'll also of course press control or command s to save the scene as well.

07:31.560 --> 07:34.360
All right I'm going to go take a look for some textures.

07:34.920 --> 07:42.480
So here in Google Images I'm searching for Lin and drape fold cloth texture and I've found a couple

07:42.480 --> 07:46.640
I like I kind of like this down here.

07:46.740 --> 07:48.610
I may grab this fact.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.180
I think I will.

07:50.370 --> 07:56.000
And there are some others down here that are kind of nice I like this as well so I'll grab that.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.890
And there were some others here let me go back.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.090
There were some.

08:00.090 --> 08:06.360
This is kind of nice because it shows the highlight and shadow of drapes.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.640
This kind of helps I think.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.160
Let me grab this one here.

08:12.180 --> 08:12.420
All right.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.410
I think that should do it.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.590
For now let's go back to blender and bring these in.

08:18.070 --> 08:22.280
All right to bring our cloth animal just once again come over here.

08:22.280 --> 08:26.780
Go to the open image browse to my cloth.

08:27.170 --> 08:28.630
I'll bring this one in.

08:30.370 --> 08:31.200
That looks good.

08:31.190 --> 08:34.240
That's got some nice color variation there.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.880
That's what I'm looking for.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.990
And then I'll also bring that third one in.

08:39.220 --> 08:46.960
So I get some sense of the drape and the light and dark shadows of that cloth Yeah I think these will

08:46.960 --> 08:49.240
help a lot.

08:49.240 --> 08:49.560
All right.

08:49.570 --> 08:54.810
I think we're set up to start working on the cloth here we'll begin that in the next video.
