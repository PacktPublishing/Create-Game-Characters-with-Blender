00:00.680 --> 00:08.000
Let's continue with our read typology by working on this shoulder piece I think what I want to do is

00:08.000 --> 00:13.170
have this mirrored part of the head be all one piece.

00:13.370 --> 00:21.020
So go back to object mode and come over here to the modifiers panel and I'll just click apply and that

00:21.020 --> 00:23.400
will now make this all one piece.

00:23.450 --> 00:32.030
So now over here what I need to do is draw out the geometry of the shoulder armor so to do that I will

00:32.030 --> 00:37.240
just click draw and let's just start drawing out the geometry we want.

00:38.140 --> 00:39.190
On this piece.

00:39.190 --> 00:41.130
So maybe something like this.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.410
And this

00:49.190 --> 00:51.390
and a couple more down here.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.840
Let's go with that and then I'll draw some cross lines here.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.820
I didn't mean to do that.

01:03.820 --> 01:05.730
Let me try that one again.

01:05.770 --> 01:07.920
I just did that with command Z

01:14.770 --> 01:15.130
right.

01:15.130 --> 01:17.580
Let's see how that works.

01:17.590 --> 01:26.810
So with that done I'll hit enter and then I'll go over to the Tools panel and click add surface and

01:26.810 --> 01:34.220
there we go now it looks like a few of these are turned the wrong way so I'll just hit the A key and

01:34.220 --> 01:39.840
press control in and see if that will get all the normals pointing the same way.

01:41.450 --> 01:48.230
I think I'm going to need another extrusion down to here as well as maybe another one down to here.

01:48.410 --> 01:55.130
But what I want to do is if I selected this edge and extrude it I want it to snap to this object.

01:55.340 --> 02:03.080
But the problem is with the multi resolution modifiers for each of these objects set to such a high

02:03.080 --> 02:07.890
resolution My computer is going to lag quite a bit.

02:07.910 --> 02:16.370
So what I need to do is come in here let me go back to object mode and for all of these multi resolution

02:16.430 --> 02:23.340
modifiers I need to really reduce that down to maybe one or two.

02:23.460 --> 02:26.870
I'll see if I can get away with two.

02:26.910 --> 02:34.590
Let me just reduce everything I'm going to take the character down to maybe maybe three for the character

02:34.590 --> 02:39.050
so I can see a little bit of that definition.

02:39.180 --> 02:40.580
Let me take this down.

02:41.660 --> 02:50.280
Two and I don't need the higher resolution while I'm doing this while I'm read apologizing.

02:50.350 --> 02:53.500
I don't need to see all that higher detail.

02:53.720 --> 02:58.970
So this will just help things move a little quicker in the viewport.

02:59.030 --> 03:07.430
So we've come down quite a bit from millions of tries to 170 thousand and that should help the viewport

03:07.460 --> 03:09.670
move a little bit better.

03:09.680 --> 03:19.070
So if I wanted to select this object and extrude these edges down I can select this edge and control

03:19.070 --> 03:20.830
select this edge.

03:20.840 --> 03:30.920
Now I can come down here and turn on snapping and I've got it set to face and closest and I want to

03:30.920 --> 03:33.450
turn on this little guy.

03:33.470 --> 03:39.450
No this little guy excuse me this project individual elements on the surface of other objects.

03:39.560 --> 03:51.100
I want to turn him on now if I extrude this and pull it down it'll kind of snap to that area like that

03:52.700 --> 03:59.310
if I come over here to the x ray you can see that it's kind of snapped to that surface and that's good

03:59.320 --> 04:00.580
that's what we want.

04:00.610 --> 04:07.380
So I like this and control like that and then I'll hit it easy and pull down to here.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.100
I be right about there.

04:12.450 --> 04:15.370
And I'll just snap these to the surface.

04:15.370 --> 04:15.560
Now

04:20.290 --> 04:22.820
I'd like this to be the point.

04:22.870 --> 04:25.740
These to move around here like that

04:35.450 --> 04:38.540
like that.

04:38.910 --> 04:45.270
I think what I'll also do is take this piece and extrude it down a bit.

04:45.750 --> 04:51.680
So maybe for extrude and pull it down to about here let's say

05:03.450 --> 05:04.220
like so.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.720
And maybe these one more time

05:11.310 --> 05:17.730
all right so I think we could probably extrude this edge up.

05:17.820 --> 05:26.280
We get hit and pull this up to the edge of this piece right here and do a little point pulling to get

05:27.060 --> 05:29.960
that basic shape again.

05:32.170 --> 05:38.320
Like this and then what I'd like to do is take this whole edge here.

05:39.770 --> 05:46.380
And maybe extrude this over to the side toward the head.

05:46.410 --> 05:52.640
So I'll hit me and move it over to this edge right here.

05:54.380 --> 05:57.670
Let's also do the same thing around the edge here.

05:58.040 --> 06:05.970
I'll just hold control and click at subsequent points around the edge here like that.

06:07.390 --> 06:14.910
And then I'm going to turn off the x ray and just hit me and let that snap down to this area.

06:16.570 --> 06:17.260
So

06:20.330 --> 06:21.950
here we go.

06:21.950 --> 06:26.690
Now I'd like to select this edge I'm just going to press alt and click that edge and then de-select

06:26.720 --> 06:36.610
this one and de-select this one and I just want to extrude this down a bit so I'll just hit E and pull

06:36.610 --> 06:37.840
that down some

06:41.240 --> 06:50.520
like that and you can press shift tab to turn you're snapping off pretty quickly and then shift tab

06:50.520 --> 06:52.900
to turn it back on if you want.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.540
I just want to merge these points here.

06:57.620 --> 06:59.810
With him and at last

07:05.080 --> 07:05.610
all right.

07:05.620 --> 07:08.830
So now let's think about connecting this up.

07:08.890 --> 07:12.470
I think we could probably connect this up here.

07:12.610 --> 07:17.430
We may need an extra edge loop here and maybe an extra edge loop here.

07:17.530 --> 07:25.020
Let's just test that and see if I insert an initially appear and I insert an edge loop here.

07:25.330 --> 07:26.470
Let's just test this.

07:26.470 --> 07:34.870
We can always undo it but I think what I'd like to do is extend this down one more row and then connect

07:34.930 --> 07:35.750
those up.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.890
Let's see what we can do here.

07:37.930 --> 07:46.580
So I'm going to turn x ray off and with snapping on I'm going to go ahead and scale this down a bit.

07:47.820 --> 07:49.370
Maybe move it into place

07:52.210 --> 07:55.240
like so.

07:55.380 --> 08:01.590
And also I might come over here to options and let me turn on X mirror and typology mirror.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.200
And what that might do for us.

08:03.210 --> 08:07.580
Let's just see if this works I'm going to select a point and hit G.

08:07.860 --> 08:17.980
And sure enough I can get mirrored movement on this with both x mirror and typology mirror on.

08:18.120 --> 08:21.730
I may not need it but I'm going to go ahead and try it for now.

08:21.880 --> 08:29.320
I'm going to slice this whole ring around the neck and hit extrude and bring this down a bit and maybe

08:29.320 --> 08:34.670
scale it out some see if I can get it to snap.

08:34.980 --> 08:44.610
So now I'll come back down under here turn on x ray and let's see if I can get these things to match

08:44.610 --> 08:45.670
up.

08:45.750 --> 08:56.100
I think maybe I could do these four vertices here and create a face and maybe these four here and create

08:56.190 --> 08:57.720
a face.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.080
See how that looks.

08:59.090 --> 09:01.180
Yeah it's not bad.

09:01.640 --> 09:14.340
And maybe these four here so now we've got the geometry of the shoulder armor and we've got it hooked

09:14.340 --> 09:16.320
up to the neck here.

09:16.320 --> 09:22.200
I think this is probably what we're going to do is connect everything up all into one piece.

09:22.200 --> 09:29.490
I may need another extrusion here and another extrusion along the neck but generally speaking I think

09:29.490 --> 09:30.930
that's going to work.

09:31.110 --> 09:39.060
I'm going to go ahead and come out of it mode here and maybe I'll just move this to layer 3 just so

09:39.060 --> 09:43.010
I can see it individually.

09:43.020 --> 09:50.630
So now we've used both the grease pencil tool with the beast surfaces add on and we've also used our

09:50.640 --> 09:52.500
snapping tools.

09:52.560 --> 09:57.890
So in the next video we'll take a look at other tools that we can use as we read to apologize.
