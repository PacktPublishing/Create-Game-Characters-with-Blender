00:00.720 --> 00:07.280
Thought I'd work on the gloves today it's really pretty much the same thing as we've done before.

00:07.280 --> 00:14.630
But I think this will combine the shrink wrap modifier with using the grease pencil to see if we can

00:14.630 --> 00:17.870
get the edges going around the thumb.

00:17.870 --> 00:25.970
So I will tab into object mode here and go to the Create tab and create a cylinder.

00:25.980 --> 00:32.950
Now when we created the cylinder for the arms I believe we used 10 sides so I'm going to do that again.

00:33.670 --> 00:34.840
Use that 10.

00:34.840 --> 00:41.050
I want to turn the cap filled to nothing because I don't need that.

00:41.230 --> 00:52.190
And let's bring this up here and maybe scale it up a bit and I'll try and place it on the arm here.

00:55.540 --> 01:03.400
And I need to add some edge loops here so I press control r and scroll the mouse wheel and let's give

01:03.400 --> 01:04.180
it.

01:04.540 --> 01:08.750
I'll give it four edges here and I'll click.

01:08.850 --> 01:15.150
And so now we've got the basic geometry of that arm cuff.

01:15.150 --> 01:18.490
So now I come over here and add a modifier.

01:18.540 --> 01:26.200
Go to shrink wrap and for this what did I call this let's see gloves.

01:26.210 --> 01:32.190
I think I called it gloves so let's choose that and there we go.

01:32.380 --> 01:40.330
I'll come back over to the object window and turn on x ray and let's take a look at it that looks pretty

01:40.330 --> 01:41.220
good.

01:41.560 --> 01:50.280
So now the trick is going to be to draw out the edges that are going to come around the thumb.

01:50.800 --> 01:56.080
But first what I need to do is apply the shrinkwrapped modifier to this.

01:56.080 --> 02:02.470
So over here in the modifiers tab I'll just click apply.

02:02.520 --> 02:07.250
Now we go now if we tab into edit mode we can see the mesh here.

02:07.650 --> 02:14.530
I think what I'll do is select this edge here and just hit E and extrude it out to here.

02:14.700 --> 02:20.670
I don't have snap on right now I'll press shift tab to turn that on and then I'll select one of these

02:20.670 --> 02:30.910
points and press the key just to snap it to this object like this.

02:30.940 --> 02:34.360
Now I mean snap these as well

02:38.300 --> 02:48.340
and we go now what I want to do is draw out the edges so that this edge can be extruded on around the

02:48.340 --> 02:50.110
thumb.

02:50.110 --> 02:57.970
So I think at least for now I'm going to turn off x ray like this.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.990
So let's go over to the grease pencil tab.

03:02.780 --> 03:09.200
And let's also come over here and press the End key to bring up the properties panel.

03:09.200 --> 03:17.540
So with this object selected in edit mode I'll go ahead and press new for a new grease pencil data block.

03:17.690 --> 03:23.630
I'll make sure and choose surface and I'll click draw.

03:23.780 --> 03:31.730
All right so now we should be able to draw out our edge loops around this thumb so maybe I'll draw one

03:31.730 --> 03:32.660
here.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.210
And here

03:39.160 --> 03:41.020
I'll draw one here.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.820
And on around

03:48.130 --> 03:50.950
maybe like this.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.140
All right let's give this a try.

03:53.160 --> 04:01.230
So I'll press ENTER or go to edge mode I'll select this edge I'll come back to Tools tab and I'll click

04:01.440 --> 04:05.370
add surface and there we go.

04:05.430 --> 04:09.490
I'm going to turn the follow down to one.

04:09.960 --> 04:10.760
And there we are.

04:10.760 --> 04:15.150
There's our edge flow around the thumb.

04:15.160 --> 04:18.240
I'll come over here and I'll turn x ray on again.

04:18.270 --> 04:20.940
So what do we need to do here.

04:20.970 --> 04:26.480
It looks to me like I could move this over here and this over here.

04:27.500 --> 04:36.860
And then maybe match these two up I'll press alt and click at the center so they merge there and then

04:36.860 --> 04:43.180
maybe I'll select these four and hit the F key and see how that works.

04:43.220 --> 04:49.960
These two look like they could merge together all press all at him and at center and match those two

04:49.960 --> 04:51.390
up.

04:51.400 --> 04:56.290
The only question I have here is if I should have added an extra edge here.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.350
It almost seems like I should have.

04:58.350 --> 05:06.740
Because then I'll have edges quads going around here so maybe I should move this up just a bit.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.250
Like so.

05:10.650 --> 05:13.870
And I'll try and insert an edge loop here and see what happens.

05:15.830 --> 05:20.030
I don't know for a little while if that was the correct thing to do.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.040
We'll see.

05:22.230 --> 05:25.550
And then I'll move this around.

05:25.700 --> 05:32.260
So what I'm trying to do is just get quads flowing out of here and quads flowing out of here.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.620
So why don't we go ahead and extend that.

05:41.700 --> 05:42.940
That's a good idea.

05:44.030 --> 05:50.060
What I'll do is I'll turn off X right here and I'm going to take the grease pencil and draw out edges

05:50.420 --> 06:01.400
this way on around trying to keep in mind these edges appear so they match.

06:01.450 --> 06:05.550
So once again I'll come over to the grease pencil and I'll draw.

06:06.040 --> 06:12.840
And let's take let's draw an edge out here to match this edge one here.

06:14.430 --> 06:15.690
One here

06:19.290 --> 06:20.720
an edge here

06:24.280 --> 06:32.350
here and one there yeah let's try that.

06:33.420 --> 06:46.140
OK so now I hit Enter I'll select this page and click add surface and take the follow down to one.

06:46.680 --> 06:52.680
All right so now we click X-ray and we've got that extending on down around the hand.

06:52.740 --> 07:01.590
So now maybe I can select this point and control select this point and then do the same thing over here.

07:01.710 --> 07:09.540
Actually I'll just go ahead and click them individually and move and selected these.

07:09.550 --> 07:15.510
Now I press control the bridge edge loops does that.

07:15.740 --> 07:27.920
And then I can select these four points hit F to create a face I could also do that here.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.660
So yeah.

07:34.690 --> 07:43.900
So now we've got kind of our base geometry for that what we need to do now is Connect them up to the

07:43.900 --> 07:45.060
arm here.

07:45.550 --> 07:53.440
So before I connect anything up I'm going to go ahead and measure it over what I'll do is move the origin

07:53.440 --> 07:57.430
to the 3D cursor because that's here at the center of the grid.

07:57.430 --> 08:03.100
The next thing I should do is apply the transformations for scale and rotation here.

08:03.090 --> 08:10.650
We're going to mirror this over some of the press control a and choose to apply the rotation and scale.

08:10.870 --> 08:16.700
And now the scale is at all ones and the rotation is at all zeroes.

08:16.720 --> 08:22.910
So now if I take this and go to the modifiers menu I can choose a mirror.

08:23.230 --> 08:26.160
And now at all Mir over to the other side.

08:26.590 --> 08:34.870
So now I'm going to go ahead and just come over to this third layer where I only have my low poly version.

08:34.870 --> 08:38.180
I need to find those arms and bring them back over here.

08:38.240 --> 08:45.890
You know they are or these arm cuffs I'll press him and bring it over to the third layer and click OK.

08:46.510 --> 08:55.860
And then what I need to do is take these guys and shift select this and I'm going to press control Jay

08:55.870 --> 08:58.190
to join them all together.

08:58.210 --> 09:08.160
So now I should be able to come in here and use the bridge tool to hook these up again so I'll select

09:08.370 --> 09:10.110
this edge with Allt click.

09:10.140 --> 09:18.840
And then this edge with Shift click and let's try this as press control E and bridge edge loops and

09:18.840 --> 09:20.030
there we go.

09:20.520 --> 09:29.290
And then let's come over to this other side over here and select this edge and shift Allt selected this

09:29.290 --> 09:30.180
ledge.

09:30.210 --> 09:34.760
Let's go ahead and press control and bridge edge loops here as well.

09:35.010 --> 09:42.550
All right so we have our arm cuffs now completed and hooked onto the arms.

09:42.690 --> 09:44.470
We're getting pretty close.

09:44.520 --> 09:51.840
I need to work on the belt of the character and the little tunic on the front and back and I need to

09:51.840 --> 09:55.880
figure out exactly what I'm going to be doing for the fingers of the character.

09:55.950 --> 10:04.830
I think what I'll do for this is actually create individual pieces or the fingers and thumb I think

10:04.830 --> 10:08.090
will be different pieces then the arm cuff.

10:08.090 --> 10:14.220
I don't have enough resolution around the fingers to get enough detail here.

10:14.460 --> 10:19.600
So I think these will be a different piece but ultimately still the same object.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.170
So we'll work on that coming up.
