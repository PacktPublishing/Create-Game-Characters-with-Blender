00:01.020 --> 00:03.940
Well we're coming along with the sculpting here.

00:03.960 --> 00:07.600
I think I'd like to work a little more on the torso today.

00:07.620 --> 00:15.780
Let's take a look at the abdominal muscles here on the front of the character for this once again I'll

00:15.840 --> 00:24.240
use the same kind of technique I'll mask out the area that we want to sculpt and then build it up from

00:24.240 --> 00:25.040
there.

00:25.530 --> 00:30.030
So the area that I'd like to sculpt I think let's take a look here.

00:30.330 --> 00:39.980
I think I'd like to mask out from the bottom of the rib cage here and around in here all the way down.

00:42.180 --> 00:43.730
Right down into here.

00:48.860 --> 00:49.870
Something like that.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.710
And then I'll just fill it in here.

00:54.730 --> 00:59.170
Now press control and invert that.

00:59.170 --> 01:01.360
Now I want to fill it in here from.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.160
So that from the side.

01:03.270 --> 01:08.230
Kind of fills in here and then dips back right at the pelvis.

01:08.290 --> 01:13.630
I'm also going to I think I'm going to get rid of that arm it's going to be in the way here I'll press

01:13.720 --> 01:20.210
h and drag so like that to hide it I'll go ahead and do that for the other arm as well.

01:21.950 --> 01:31.190
And we go so I'll go back to my clay strips brush with the three key and let's come in here and start

01:31.670 --> 01:35.770
building out the form I'm going to reduce the strength a bit.

01:37.710 --> 01:41.360
And just begin building this out just a little bit at a time.

01:51.960 --> 01:56.260
And I'm just trying to keep an eye on it from the side here as I go.

01:56.420 --> 02:03.520
I wanted to kind of bulge out from here and kind of have at its peak around at the top of the pelvis.

02:14.530 --> 02:15.330
There we go.

02:15.520 --> 02:22.270
So as you can see it's bulging out just a bit until the top of the pelvis and that's kind of the way

02:22.270 --> 02:24.180
I think it should be.

02:24.190 --> 02:27.110
So now we have the basic form of the abdomen.

02:27.580 --> 02:32.280
Now what I'd like to do is build up the six pack abs on him.

02:32.290 --> 02:39.910
So what I'm going to do is once again mask those off the first I'll come down here to hide mask and

02:39.910 --> 02:49.620
I'll clear the mask with Allt M. and we go now I'm going to come in and mask off the areas for that

02:49.620 --> 02:51.480
six pack abs.

02:52.020 --> 02:59.310
So I'll come over here to the mask brush and now these He's kind of tall and thin I've kind of got an

02:59.400 --> 03:04.230
elongated torso on them but we can work with that.

03:04.230 --> 03:10.750
I think I'm going to begin here maybe kind of angled this down just a bit.

03:11.830 --> 03:21.510
Bring it down and just so it's just below the rib cage there and then kind of angle it and zoom in a

03:21.510 --> 03:22.040
bit.

03:22.050 --> 03:27.850
I'm going to press control and erase that area just a bit.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.260
And then mask this area here.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.260
Kind of tilting down again.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.240
This way.

03:40.260 --> 03:40.950
And

03:43.400 --> 03:49.190
this area right in here is where the navel will probably go.

03:49.730 --> 03:56.040
And then on down here to the bottom of this abdomen area

03:58.890 --> 04:04.910
and bring that around like that so let's see how this works.

04:05.290 --> 04:08.350
So I'll fill them in and then we'll try it.

04:09.590 --> 04:18.920
So press control I need to invert the mask and I'll go back to my clay strips brush and add a pretty

04:18.920 --> 04:19.910
low strength.

04:19.910 --> 04:21.740
I'm going to try it pretty low here.

04:23.250 --> 04:28.010
I'm going to start laying down some forms here.

04:30.360 --> 04:42.140
Raises strength just a hair.

04:42.370 --> 04:49.530
Maybe I'll flatten this just a bit.

04:49.640 --> 04:54.980
So what I'm going to try now is I'm going to try and invert this mask just for a minute here and then

04:54.980 --> 05:01.520
I'm going to come in and try and cut it in just a little bit in between holding the control key down.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.100
I'm going to try and cut in between these.

05:04.250 --> 05:10.230
See if that helps at all and then control the inverse to invert them again.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.840
And now come back and do a little bit more here.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.620
All right let's see how this works someone press Allt him to clear the mask.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.850
And we're getting there.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.110
Maybe add a little bit more in now that I can see the whole thing.

05:31.210 --> 05:37.750
Ultimately we will be adding more subdivisions here so that we can get more detailed but I'm purposefully

05:38.050 --> 05:46.600
trying to keep it fairly low resolution so that I have to deal with just the basic forms and not deal

05:46.600 --> 05:51.610
with the fine details quite yet.

05:51.610 --> 05:59.650
All right so now I'm also going to begin filling in some of the forms in between the major muscle groups

05:59.650 --> 06:05.850
here just to fill it out just a little bit so I can see how it's going to play here.

06:08.550 --> 06:15.480
Now let's take a look at building out the forms of the LAT's on the back of the torso and underneath

06:15.480 --> 06:16.620
the arms here.

06:16.620 --> 06:23.880
It's really a big triangle that goes kind of from the one under-armed to the other and then down here

06:23.880 --> 06:26.210
to the base of the spine.

06:26.460 --> 06:35.640
So what I'm going to do is press the H key and I'm going to hide the arms for now that and this and

06:35.640 --> 06:45.460
then I want to mask out the general form so I go back to my mask brush reduce the size a bit with the

06:45.460 --> 06:53.800
F key and what I'm going to do is begin kind of up here and go underneath the scapula.

06:53.800 --> 07:03.640
So I'll begin here and go down underneath the scapula here and I want to come up here to the underarm

07:04.210 --> 07:11.590
and I want to come back out of the underarm just kind of right from the middle of that and then come

07:11.590 --> 07:16.710
back down here to the base of the spine.

07:20.850 --> 07:33.310
Something like this.

07:33.490 --> 07:40.020
All right so just like before I press control I need to invert that go back to the clay brush.

07:40.210 --> 07:44.940
And what I want to do is build up from the spine out.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.790
So I kind of want to build up like this.

07:48.820 --> 07:53.150
So it builds up going outward from the spine.

07:53.560 --> 07:57.100
And also I'm going I'm going to build up this area underneath the arms

08:06.930 --> 08:13.800
right now going to go ahead and clear the mask with him and I'm going to try and kind of incorporate

08:13.830 --> 08:21.870
this into the shape of the character a little better I better bring back those arms to bring back old

08:21.930 --> 08:24.690
age to bring back the arms.

08:25.840 --> 08:32.470
And I'd like to just build this out a little bit more so it blends in with the rest of the forms.

08:42.930 --> 08:50.220
And for this area over the scapula I think I now need to go ahead and lay down some form over that some

08:50.220 --> 08:54.700
skin and muscle over that bone there like that.

08:56.110 --> 09:02.360
Once again kind of incorporating the forms together just a little bit more as we go.

09:02.360 --> 09:09.590
So now we've got the lats under the arms here and that triangular shape in the back.

09:09.590 --> 09:14.810
Once again we will need to incorporate it more with the other parts of the body but still we're beginning

09:14.840 --> 09:19.350
to block in the general forms of our character here.

09:19.520 --> 09:27.410
We should begin working on the forearms and lower legs here and the next video I really want to emphasize

09:27.410 --> 09:35.780
the importance of beginning with the rough forms first and keeping the model at a fairly low resolution

09:35.840 --> 09:40.260
while you get the basic silhouette of the character.

09:40.280 --> 09:47.570
So we've still got quite a bit of work to do maybe even scaling and read proportioning of the character

09:47.810 --> 09:50.940
once all the major muscle groups are in.

09:50.960 --> 09:56.840
So it's important to get through this stage before we begin dealing with any of the fine details and

09:56.840 --> 10:02.380
even building out the character's clothes or armor or anything like that.
