00:00.720 --> 00:07.160
One of the things we need to think about when sculpting is to try and get our base mesh to the party

00:07.170 --> 00:09.890
lines are relatively the same size.

00:10.030 --> 00:14.880
Now the words I'm going to have to insert a few editors because if you look at the arms here we have

00:14.880 --> 00:20.150
these huge polygons here and then over here they're pretty small.

00:20.430 --> 00:24.840
So we need to begin thinking about getting them a little bit more the same size they're never gonna

00:24.870 --> 00:27.450
be all exactly the same.

00:27.450 --> 00:34.260
But I think we need to get them a little bit more uniform so to do that.

00:34.260 --> 00:40.920
One thing I've noticed here is I'm going to need a new edge loop right around the shoulders to kind

00:40.920 --> 00:42.630
of hold the shoulders.

00:42.630 --> 00:48.180
And the problem is is if I insert an edge loop them I'm just going to press control are here I can insert

00:48.180 --> 00:58.070
an edge loop here or I can insert and actually appear but I can't get one to wrap around like a necklace

00:58.070 --> 01:01.040
here all the way around the shoulders.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.020
So how to get that edge in there.

01:04.070 --> 01:11.270
What I'm to do is press control r and insert an edge loop up here at the neckline and then I want to

01:11.270 --> 01:19.030
press Alt click and I want to select this loop all the way around here like this

01:21.570 --> 01:25.180
nominee hit the one key to go back to the front view.

01:25.460 --> 01:31.340
And then what I can do is I can slide this edge down to be the edge that I want to create.

01:31.340 --> 01:34.850
So what we need is that slide edge tool again I'm going to press control.

01:34.850 --> 01:45.790
We go to Ed slide and I'll just drag the mouse out and it'll pull that edge down like that and I'll

01:45.790 --> 01:47.800
just pull that back up.

01:47.800 --> 01:52.960
Now we may need to do a little point pulling here and that's certainly fine.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.940
I can pull these up a bit and ultimately will need to pull these out.

01:57.070 --> 02:01.580
So they're more uniformly distributed along the front here.

02:01.990 --> 02:05.510
But that's what I wanted to get for now at least.

02:05.740 --> 02:13.330
I'll also do the same thing with this edge of press control i.e. an edge slide and drag that down a

02:13.480 --> 02:14.340
hair.

02:14.800 --> 02:22.040
And then I want to insert one more in here like so maybe scale that in a bit.

02:23.110 --> 02:29.180
All right so that makes those polygons a little bit more uniform as they're coming off of the neck and

02:29.200 --> 02:31.940
down into the shoulder.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.270
But let's look at the arms here.

02:34.420 --> 02:39.940
I think I could use an edge loop right around here in the middle.

02:39.940 --> 02:49.150
And another one right around here on the forearm that splits that up into more uniform polygons and

02:49.150 --> 03:00.560
then down here I think I'll do the same thing just mid shin here and maybe mid thigh here.

03:01.940 --> 03:05.420
That would go for the torso area.

03:05.420 --> 03:08.320
I feel like I need just at least one more here.

03:08.330 --> 03:18.190
I think I'm going to select this edge around the bottom of the rib cage just move that up a hair.

03:18.290 --> 03:27.500
I think I want to take these at the hips and move these down slightly like that.

03:27.940 --> 03:30.680
I want to insert an edge loop right around in here.

03:30.730 --> 03:35.650
I just want three edge loops coming off of the bottom of the arm.

03:35.650 --> 03:43.120
So if I have this edge here at the bottom of the arms I'm going to want one here two three and then

03:43.120 --> 03:44.280
the legs begin here.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.510
I think that will give me enough to work with.

03:47.510 --> 03:54.720
So at this stage it's really all about preparing for the sculped part of the process.

03:54.760 --> 04:02.770
I'm just trying to give myself enough resolution so that the sculp tool can subdivided evenly without

04:02.770 --> 04:08.280
overloading the geometry with more polygons and we actually need.

04:08.290 --> 04:08.580
All right.

04:08.590 --> 04:11.270
Let's take a look at the hands.

04:11.410 --> 04:21.420
I'm going to come in here and I'd like to just select these vertices here and what I want to do is I

04:21.420 --> 04:29.400
think I'd like to create the hands here so there's slightly facing down thumbs forward.

04:29.490 --> 04:34.530
I think that'll be an easier pose to rig ultimately.

04:34.830 --> 04:39.190
So let's think about how we want to do the hands here.

04:39.360 --> 04:44.790
I think I'm going to need extra edge loops at the back of the arm and at the front to the arm and that'll

04:44.790 --> 04:49.000
give me enough resolution to build out the fingers.

04:49.050 --> 04:56.800
So if I control r and insert an edge loop right here and do the same.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.390
Oh it went all the way around here.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.420
Good.

05:00.550 --> 05:04.680
I think I'd like to get this edge a little higher.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.220
So I'm just going to move some edges around here.

05:09.000 --> 05:18.210
Real quick with the slide to all I just think these pages are a little bit too close together right

05:18.210 --> 05:18.720
now.

05:22.820 --> 05:23.980
There we go.

05:24.590 --> 05:25.430
Yeah.

05:25.850 --> 05:30.020
So now we have a little bit more resolution down here.

05:30.020 --> 05:33.530
Not a lot but I think enough to work with.

05:33.530 --> 05:37.200
All right so I'm going to grab these faces.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.510
So I think I want to change this to normal real quick.

05:43.510 --> 05:52.090
The transformation orientation currently the orientation of the manipulators here is based on the world

05:52.090 --> 05:53.100
coordinates.

05:53.140 --> 06:01.510
I think I want them to be based on the normal coordinates of the faces that I've got selected here so

06:01.510 --> 06:03.530
I'll just change that to normal.

06:03.640 --> 06:13.490
I'll zoom in here and I'll scale these so they're a little bit flatter select those faces hit extrude

06:13.970 --> 06:15.710
and I'm going to pull straight out.

06:19.440 --> 06:25.470
Now what I want to do is take these points here right here and scale these in

06:28.730 --> 06:41.790
and bring these back like so toward the palm of the hand like so and now it's this area that we're going

06:41.790 --> 06:44.170
to extrude the thumb out of.

06:44.550 --> 06:49.600
So I'll go back to face mode and hit each for extrude.

06:49.620 --> 06:58.020
I'm going to click and go straight to the move tool and scale and rotate etc. and then I'm going to

06:58.020 --> 07:04.740
bring the thumb out a little more and hit extrude again go straight to the move to press the key scale

07:04.770 --> 07:07.130
in a hair more.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.340
And lastly one more time.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.760
For the tip of the thumb like this

07:16.820 --> 07:22.200
right so now let's see if I can get this edge back.

07:22.220 --> 07:28.070
So I'm going to select this edge with the Alt key and move it back a bit scaled up some.

07:28.310 --> 07:33.820
So that's going to be our thumb or at least the basis of our thumb.

07:34.070 --> 07:42.200
Keep in mind I'm keeping everything pretty small pretty skinny because as I said we're going to need

07:42.200 --> 07:45.440
room to build the sculped out.

07:45.440 --> 07:45.710
All right.

07:45.710 --> 07:51.370
So let's call that our thumb for now we'll see if we need to adjust that here.

07:51.920 --> 08:00.040
I can move this little point this way and maybe move this point a little this way like that.

08:00.380 --> 08:00.900
OK.

08:00.920 --> 08:06.740
So now what I'm going to do is move these up into here like this.

08:06.740 --> 08:16.340
And the interesting thing about this is that we're going to get rid of this whole area here at the bottom.

08:16.630 --> 08:20.980
So notice now I've got four edges here.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.630
One two three four.

08:24.660 --> 08:29.330
Those are the edges that are going to be the basis of the fingers.

08:29.340 --> 08:38.160
Now I don't have four edges here I just have to sort of what let's do is let's go back to the face mode

08:38.190 --> 08:40.370
and select these faces.

08:40.470 --> 08:47.640
And what I want to do is just delete a moment hit the x key and go to faces what I need to do is make

08:47.640 --> 08:50.100
it so these.

08:50.340 --> 08:57.910
So the top of the hand has four faces on it just like the palm of the hand.

08:57.930 --> 09:05.610
So what I'm going to do is just select these two faces and instead of just hitting the key which is

09:05.610 --> 09:14.880
the extrude button over here I'm going to choose extrude individual faces and then just move the mouse

09:14.880 --> 09:21.870
a bit and you can see they're kind of coming out individually right there to two different faces as

09:21.870 --> 09:25.020
opposed to all one Samana right click.

09:25.080 --> 09:30.860
And now I want to go back to that individual origins and scale these in if I hit the ESC key and scale

09:30.860 --> 09:32.300
I'm in.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.720
Now we get that.

09:35.020 --> 09:41.890
And at this point I can use that knife tool again to create a few edges here so I'm going to press the

09:41.890 --> 09:51.910
K key and hover over here so I get this edge and draw it straight out to here and press enter.

09:52.750 --> 09:57.050
So like this one draw straight out to here and hit enter.

09:57.550 --> 10:03.500
And then one more I'm going to go here to here and enter.

10:03.580 --> 10:13.560
And now I can go back to edges and select this edge and this edge and press X and dissolve edges.

10:13.570 --> 10:24.350
Now I've got one two three four edges that I can work with here to build out the fingers.

10:24.490 --> 10:31.310
So I'm going to start moving these around spacing them with the edge slide tool.

10:31.870 --> 10:38.350
So now that we have our edges matching up what let's do is go ahead and fill this hole with a face and

10:38.350 --> 10:44.130
then we can cut edges into it to prepare for extruding out the fingers.

10:44.290 --> 10:50.590
So I'll select this entire edge with all to select and then I'll just press the F key and that will

10:50.620 --> 10:53.700
fill that whole thing with a face.

10:53.710 --> 11:01.780
Now I can come back with the knife tool again I'll go to Virtex mode and press the K key and I'll just

11:02.560 --> 11:12.710
select these points right here and hit enter K and create these edges.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.090
And there we go.

11:14.370 --> 11:21.270
So now we have the faces that we can extrude the fingers out of and begin down here with the pinky like

11:21.270 --> 11:23.890
that face.

11:23.970 --> 11:26.620
And let's just begin extruding this out.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.490
So I'll hit the extrude scale down a bit.

11:33.700 --> 11:46.270
And again and move this and scale and rotated hair and once again easy and move and rotate and scale.

11:46.270 --> 11:49.550
So that's what we need to do for all of these.

11:49.730 --> 11:50.030
Right.

11:50.030 --> 11:52.120
I'll go ahead and do it for the next one here.

11:59.390 --> 12:09.230
Now you may or may not have notice that my character the character drawing that I've provided the goblin

12:09.830 --> 12:12.500
actually only has four fingers.

12:12.500 --> 12:17.150
He's only got or he's got three fingers and a thumb.

12:17.300 --> 12:26.170
But I thought that would be more beneficial to show how to create a normal hand with all five fingers.

12:26.360 --> 12:32.070
So my goblin may be a little bit different then my reference image.

12:32.120 --> 12:38.840
I just thought this would be a little more useful to people creating their own characters.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.040
All right so there we have our hands.

12:41.060 --> 12:47.420
We're getting there we're getting closer to the point where we can actually begin sculpting our polygons

12:47.420 --> 12:51.710
are getting a little bit more proportional and a little bit more evenly sized.

12:51.710 --> 12:53.590
We've got our hands set up.

12:53.600 --> 13:01.100
There may be more adjusting we need to do but in the next video I think we'll deal with the face creating

13:01.220 --> 13:04.570
basic edge loop patterns for the eyes and the mouth.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.010
And also we're going to need to extrude the ears out.

13:07.010 --> 13:10.160
I keep forgetting that this guy's got pretty big ears.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.450
And we go so we need to do the ears as well.
