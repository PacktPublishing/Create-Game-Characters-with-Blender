00:00.990 --> 00:07.030
Well against my better judgment I'm going to start with the characters skin on the torso.

00:07.530 --> 00:12.430
I figured I'd just go ahead and jump right in and see how it goes.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.580
I've already got some colors picked out.

00:14.580 --> 00:25.500
I created a new palette here called skin and I've gone ahead and added some colors off of this reference

00:25.500 --> 00:27.200
image of an iguana.

00:27.210 --> 00:30.420
It's got some really nice greens and browns in it.

00:30.420 --> 00:34.610
And that's what I picked up here also for reference.

00:34.610 --> 00:37.040
I went ahead and took some selfies.

00:38.170 --> 00:41.610
Why are you laughing.

00:41.670 --> 00:49.860
Anyway I wanted to get a few reference images of just the anatomy of the torso.

00:49.920 --> 00:57.390
I think what I want to do is begin with this darker color here something like this and begin just laying

00:57.390 --> 01:02.370
down the shadows of the muscle tones.

01:02.400 --> 01:07.620
Let me swing down here and reduce the strength.

01:07.620 --> 01:13.670
I've still got a texture on and I think I'm going to go with that for now just to see how it works.

01:13.710 --> 01:18.130
I've got jitter pretty low and spacing pretty low so let's just see how this works.

01:18.150 --> 01:27.060
Also down here in the curves now the default curve for our brush is usually this and this curve is just

01:27.060 --> 01:32.280
kind of half of the curve of the brush so the brush.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.990
This is the edge or widest part of the brush.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.230
And then this is the top of the brush.

01:38.250 --> 01:44.620
And then this is the other half over here so this is just kind of half of the curve of the brush.

01:44.730 --> 01:48.790
I'm going to go ahead and go with this one and see how this works.

01:48.810 --> 01:55.710
This should I think Feather the edges a little bit better we'll see how that works.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.750
All right let's give this a try.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.140
Flying without a net here.

01:59.190 --> 02:02.790
Let's see if we can do.

02:02.790 --> 02:07.920
All right I'm going to come in here and I'm just going to begin with the pecs and let me just draw and

02:07.920 --> 02:08.710
see.

02:09.000 --> 02:09.920
OK.

02:10.230 --> 02:10.980
That's not bad.

02:10.980 --> 02:11.840
Let me do this.

02:11.880 --> 02:19.760
Oh also you know what I should do is come up here to symmetry and turn on X symmetry.

02:19.800 --> 02:27.570
Now whenever I draw on one side it should come over on the other side.

02:27.590 --> 02:37.010
And doing that also helps me realize that I need to mask off the torso from the rest of the character

02:37.020 --> 02:39.000
so let me undo that.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.710
Now let's come down here and turn on face masking.

02:43.790 --> 02:48.540
I'll hit the A key a couple times to make sure everything's de-selected and then I'm just going to hover

02:48.540 --> 02:58.880
over this and press the key and hitting the L key will just select those areas that have been defined

02:58.880 --> 03:00.250
by the seams.

03:00.290 --> 03:03.220
When we mapped well when we hit the L key.

03:03.310 --> 03:06.400
Here grab this area up here.

03:06.410 --> 03:12.450
I don't think I'll be doing the face today but just in case I am kind of go over.

03:12.920 --> 03:13.180
All right.

03:13.190 --> 03:16.380
Let me reduce the brush strength and down again.

03:17.430 --> 03:22.620
And let's see if we can do here so I'm going to come over here and just start down here and try and

03:22.620 --> 03:32.160
pick up the Shadow down underneath the pecs maybe get the shadow between here as well.

03:32.410 --> 03:35.290
Something like that.

03:35.520 --> 03:42.150
And I'm going to extend that over here.

03:42.220 --> 03:49.230
I wanted to find the deltoids a bit up here and maybe back here.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.000
Let's see if I can see.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.710
Yeah I think right in here.

03:55.810 --> 03:58.510
And pick up the Shadow down here.

03:58.870 --> 04:02.430
So I'm just trying to help define.

04:02.440 --> 04:09.640
Once again what we've already done with the normal map and I'm keeping an eye over here on my on my

04:09.640 --> 04:11.310
selfies.

04:13.260 --> 04:16.300
To make sure I'm doing all right.

04:16.680 --> 04:17.820
Let me get these

04:20.630 --> 04:22.420
muscles in here.

04:28.010 --> 04:28.560
OK.

04:28.560 --> 04:34.230
So we're beginning to get some of the muscle tone there.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.230
Let's go round the back and see if we can do here.

04:38.590 --> 04:44.540
Let's get this between the shoulder blades here.

04:47.200 --> 04:59.430
Maybe down on the back.

05:00.780 --> 05:07.890
We could probably help define the biceps a little better down here.

05:10.910 --> 05:14.770
And also the little bit of the elbow right in here.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.990
And maybe a shadow underneath the elbow out here.

05:20.260 --> 05:27.160
So I'm just as I said I'm just trying to help define what's already there.

05:29.280 --> 05:36.090
Now one thing I did want to mention here is I did add a new slot called skin.

05:36.090 --> 05:43.260
So this is just another texture paint slot that I've added and reduced the alpha all the way to zero.

05:43.740 --> 05:46.050
So I can paint over this.

05:46.050 --> 05:53.430
Once again it's a great idea to do this on its own layer because you can erase and begin over if you

05:53.430 --> 05:58.260
need to or at least make adjustments like I'm looking at this now.

05:58.290 --> 06:07.920
And to me this right here doesn't seem to work very well so I'm going to flip my pen over and just bring

06:07.920 --> 06:15.600
the strength up a bit and maybe try and erase that back a hair just doesn't seem to be working for me

06:15.600 --> 06:16.880
as well.

06:16.930 --> 06:21.900
Now I can move the strength back down and flip my pen back over.

06:21.900 --> 06:30.210
All right so now that we've got the shadows kind of drawn in here what I'd like to do now is do some

06:30.210 --> 06:37.980
of the highlights and I've got this color I believe I could use for highlights.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.990
I think this may be a little bit too bright.

06:41.070 --> 06:41.940
We could try it.

06:42.090 --> 06:45.830
Let me try this and see.

06:46.750 --> 06:51.500
Yeah I mean it just that looks a little too bright.

06:51.510 --> 06:52.880
How about how about this

06:56.750 --> 06:57.800
still a little much.

06:57.810 --> 07:02.310
And let me try this one I think this is the one I had in mind for this.

07:02.360 --> 07:09.830
Let me reduce the strength the hair and see if I can come in and create just a little bit of highlights

07:09.830 --> 07:11.350
on here.

07:11.390 --> 07:19.100
So now I'm just going to come through next to all of the shadows and just try and add a little bit of

07:19.100 --> 07:20.410
highlight to it.

07:20.780 --> 07:24.500
So maybe up here on the deltoids.

07:24.500 --> 07:36.330
So maybe along this little muscle here of course we need it along the biceps something like this.

07:36.470 --> 07:41.510
Let me work on these muscles here just to try and put a little highlight on them.

07:44.380 --> 07:50.660
Let's go in and get even more of a highlight so maybe something like this.

07:50.890 --> 08:00.310
And I think what I'll also do is increase my jitter and spacing on this just a little bit so that I

08:00.310 --> 08:02.910
kind of hopefully get a bit of a texture.

08:03.890 --> 08:06.500
Let's see try again.

08:07.550 --> 08:08.020
Yeah.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.860
So I want this kind of thing.

08:09.860 --> 08:10.400
All right.

08:11.620 --> 08:12.820
So let me try this

08:25.690 --> 08:26.610
all right.

08:26.620 --> 08:30.570
So now I've got this stuff down.

08:30.680 --> 08:41.510
I'm going to try and use that smear brush and see if I can kind of blend things together a little bit.

08:41.510 --> 08:48.150
Let's go back and try and use this smear brush see if this works at all.

08:48.230 --> 08:52.920
See if we can blim things together a bit.

08:53.040 --> 08:57.620
I'm going to increase the strength just a bit so we can see what's happening.

08:58.390 --> 09:06.980
And then you just see you can kind of smooth these out just a bit.

09:07.130 --> 09:15.460
So they're not quite so rough and prominent that may be a little too much down here.

09:18.880 --> 09:22.460
Something like this so yeah just smoothing this back.

09:23.540 --> 09:30.840
It's not quite so.

09:31.290 --> 09:31.800
All right.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.100
That's looking pretty good.

09:33.100 --> 09:37.190
Now the last thing I want to do here is let me try

09:39.950 --> 09:44.860
let me try a very light highlight here.

09:45.350 --> 09:46.450
Let me try this.

09:46.460 --> 09:54.480
I'm going to take now I think I'll leave that on but I'm going to take the jitter and the spacing down

09:54.490 --> 09:56.980
some.

09:57.040 --> 10:04.150
And I think I'd like to try and just add a few very bright highlights to this.

10:04.200 --> 10:10.280
Let's see if we can do this without it being too too much.

10:10.330 --> 10:10.900
Let me try.

10:10.900 --> 10:16.930
Let me just test this may be a bit too much.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.540
I'm going to take the texture out to test that.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.990
OK that's a little bit better and more what I was thinking.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.270
All right so where should we put these highlights.

10:28.450 --> 10:30.500
Probably on the clavicle up here.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.260
Probably along here let's say something like that

10:43.980 --> 10:51.360
and looks like I'm just looking at these areas here just to try and figure out where the highlight should

10:51.360 --> 10:52.070
go.

10:54.970 --> 10:58.590
And then maybe once again along the bicep here

11:01.700 --> 11:08.570
maybe down here on top of these muscles here.

11:08.630 --> 11:26.660
Let's try this.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.140
And where else maybe one right along in here.

11:33.510 --> 11:36.130
Maybe this right back in here.

11:38.690 --> 11:44.260
Let's take a look in the back here maybe we want a highlight here.

11:45.890 --> 11:49.410
And one down here on the elbow Let's try that

11:52.250 --> 11:52.950
there's that.

11:52.970 --> 11:53.800
OK.

11:53.830 --> 11:59.580
So let's turn off the face masking here.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.200
And we go Well let's take a look at it.

12:05.710 --> 12:06.220
Well all right.

12:06.220 --> 12:07.200
Not too bad.

12:07.210 --> 12:17.230
I think there's some work I could do by using the smear tool again and maybe even racing back a few

12:17.230 --> 12:19.850
of the really strong highlights.

12:20.200 --> 12:26.980
But other than that I think you get a good sense of kind of what you can do with just the texture painting.

12:27.070 --> 12:34.480
And once again have it emphasized and highlight what's going on in the normal map.

12:34.700 --> 12:42.920
So I'll keep working here on the rest of the body maybe in the next video will work on the head and

12:42.920 --> 12:47.660
try and get the head and the face done and hey we're almost done with this.
