00:00.580 --> 00:02.650
Well I'm still working on the fingers here.

00:02.650 --> 00:04.610
Let's go ahead and zoom in.

00:06.250 --> 00:09.000
And I've got just the forefingers done.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.750
I haven't done the thumb yet but I wanted to just talk about hooking these up and extruding them back.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.810
These are all currently individual objects.

00:18.810 --> 00:25.760
So what I need to do is go ahead and select them all in press control J to join them into all one object.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.320
So now we tap into edit mode.

00:27.330 --> 00:30.910
We can see all of the components for each one.

00:30.930 --> 00:34.310
So now what I need to do is I need to connect them together.

00:34.500 --> 00:42.390
So I think when I'm going to do is just move this point and back and just select this edge and this

00:42.390 --> 00:50.310
edge and bridge these two so I'll just press control E and bridge edge loops and then I'll do the same

00:50.310 --> 00:54.060
thing with these over here this edge and this edge.

00:54.070 --> 00:55.570
Now try that again.

00:55.690 --> 01:09.060
There it is control the bridge edge loops and let's try this one over here for these two.

01:09.220 --> 01:09.690
All right.

01:09.700 --> 01:14.350
So now that we have those hooked up and they may need a little bit of point pulling to get them a little

01:14.350 --> 01:19.480
more even around the top of the fingers there.

01:19.780 --> 01:26.950
But generally speaking that's kind of what I want is these fingers to be connected up so that when we

01:26.950 --> 01:32.350
select this edge that entire edge you get selected all the way around.

01:32.350 --> 01:37.220
The problem is is we've got these extra edges selected in here and we don't want that.

01:37.450 --> 01:43.740
So I'm going to just go to edge mode here and de-select these edges here we don't need these.

01:43.780 --> 01:46.090
I only want the ones on the outside.

01:47.070 --> 01:55.830
Like so now that we've got all of those selected I'm just going to now press e for extrude and move

01:55.830 --> 01:57.860
them back up into the glove.

01:57.870 --> 02:03.600
But I think what I'd like to do is have the characters body visible to do that so I'll tab back into

02:03.600 --> 02:07.530
object mode and just select this first layer as well.

02:07.530 --> 02:12.690
And now I should be able to see that as extruded back.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.030
All right so now I could go back into edit mode.

02:16.040 --> 02:20.160
I'll hit E for extrude and bring that back a bit.

02:20.270 --> 02:29.330
Keeping an eye on it here I think I want to scale it this way just a hair.

02:29.340 --> 02:34.950
Now let's go ahead and do one more extrusion up into that glove.

02:35.920 --> 02:43.990
So I'll select all of these edges all the way around and extrude these up into here.

02:45.400 --> 02:51.090
So now we're going to need to do some point pulling to get to get the fingers to fit within that glove

02:51.490 --> 02:52.180
but that's fine.

02:52.180 --> 02:55.290
We kind of expected that.

02:55.480 --> 03:04.660
Now I think I will want this edge for the glove or the gauntlet to be extruded in so we can see up into

03:04.660 --> 03:05.100
it.

03:05.170 --> 03:14.700
So I'll just select that edge and hit me and then S and scale that in pretty far there like that.

03:14.710 --> 03:19.390
In addition we're going to need to get a thumb in there aren't we.

03:19.390 --> 03:21.500
So let's take a look at doing that.

03:21.610 --> 03:23.320
I think all I really need to do.

03:23.320 --> 03:27.740
Let me turn on the character model there.

03:28.670 --> 03:36.360
And Kyle I really need to do is just grab part of one of these fingers duplicated and bring it up here.

03:37.440 --> 03:41.040
Yes so I will tap into edit mode here.

03:41.240 --> 03:52.760
And I think what I'll do is select this ring of faces press control plus to expand that selection and

03:52.760 --> 03:56.070
maybe bring it right up to about here.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.720
Let's try that.

03:57.960 --> 04:02.070
I'll then press shift D and enter.

04:02.200 --> 04:08.700
I'll then press the P key and separate the selected object into its own object.

04:09.550 --> 04:18.610
And then now if we tab back here it is I'll move the origin to the geometry.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.340
Now I think to move it around or switch the transform orientation to global.

04:22.520 --> 04:31.240
And now we can just move this around and place it on the thumb.

04:31.510 --> 04:35.030
Now that I have it here I see it's a little bit too thin.

04:35.260 --> 04:37.720
Instead of scaling it out all the way like this.

04:37.720 --> 04:43.630
I think what I'll do is tap into edit mode and select everything and I'm going to come over to the tools

04:43.630 --> 04:49.420
tab and with this shrink Fatton tool I'll just click that and then just scale it up and it'll just kind

04:49.420 --> 04:50.860
of chunk it up a bit.

04:51.690 --> 04:55.810
So now I'm going to turn off that first layer.

04:56.100 --> 05:05.230
And there's our thumb that we've now got to extend back into the glove so I'll just tab into edit mode.

05:05.230 --> 05:06.240
Good edge mode.

05:06.250 --> 05:10.460
And let's just take this and extrude it back.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.720
It'll be scaled up a bit.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.080
And one more time.

05:19.990 --> 05:24.690
Now I think I'm going to need to scale these up a bit as it comes into the glove

05:30.610 --> 05:35.320
and maybe even move it over a bit like that.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.030
And now I'll do the same thing with the glove.

05:40.030 --> 05:47.050
I'll just take this edge and extrude and scale it in to close that off.

05:47.050 --> 05:47.850
And there we go.

05:48.840 --> 05:55.200
Still a little bit of work to do but I think that will work in terms of the fingers and the glove.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.480
Well we're getting pretty close here aren't we.

05:57.480 --> 06:04.050
I think the last thing we have to do is to deal with the tunic here and the belt and I still need to

06:04.050 --> 06:07.690
come back up here and deal with the mouth and the eyes.

06:07.980 --> 06:10.030
But we should be able do those pretty quickly.
