00:00.490 --> 00:06.180
What we've established our frame range for our idol cycle and animated the chest control.

00:06.220 --> 00:12.760
All right so what let's do is let's go to frame 30 and let's work on where these hands are going to

00:12.760 --> 00:13.370
be.

00:13.420 --> 00:19.150
What are they going to do I think as he breathes in maybe that hand will move out just a hair so I'll

00:19.150 --> 00:26.950
just select that and move it out slightly and maybe move this one out slightly as well.

00:28.240 --> 00:29.760
I like that.

00:30.170 --> 00:35.150
And then I'm going to take the keyframes for the hands right here.

00:35.150 --> 00:41.610
So like these two shift d to duplicate and move them over to frame 60 as well.

00:43.550 --> 00:46.020
Rigaud Let's try that.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.010
All right.

00:55.440 --> 01:03.120
What we've got here is some classic twinning the arms doing exactly the same thing at exactly the same

01:03.120 --> 01:03.570
time.

01:03.570 --> 01:11.120
So I'd like to kind of stagger that a bit but the timing once again doesn't look too bad.

01:11.250 --> 01:18.180
So I'm going to come over here to frame 30 and I think what I want to do is just take one of these and

01:18.180 --> 01:24.270
move them forward just a bit and take the other one and move it back just a bit and see what happens

01:24.270 --> 01:24.800
here.

01:25.020 --> 01:27.800
Let's also take a look at the head now.

01:28.140 --> 01:29.970
What should the head be doing.

01:30.950 --> 01:37.060
I feel like as the chest comes out the head should come down just a bit.

01:37.490 --> 01:38.690
So let's take a look at that.

01:38.690 --> 01:46.100
I'll bring it back to frame 30 at this point in time and I'll tilt it down just a hair and then I'll

01:46.100 --> 01:49.440
select that first key frame for the head.

01:49.460 --> 01:52.610
Duplicate it and move it out to frame 60.

01:52.610 --> 02:01.210
So now we've got that looping from frame 1 through 30 to frame 60.

02:01.210 --> 02:02.620
Let's take a look at that

02:07.530 --> 02:12.390
so it looks to me like it's let me zoom in here.

02:12.390 --> 02:14.610
Now we've selected the head.

02:14.720 --> 02:24.980
And let me zoom in to see if we can find here when it hit the period key on the numpad to zoom in.

02:25.140 --> 02:33.180
And if I open up the head item here and the graph editor I can see the individual location rotation

02:33.180 --> 02:40.400
and scale here and it looks like I want to take a look at the the rotation in the x.

02:40.440 --> 02:45.830
It looks like it's got quite a large curve here at the beginning.

02:46.790 --> 02:52.890
Well let's see what happens if we then duplicate this I'm going to take this one keyframe here and press

02:52.890 --> 03:00.490
shift D and move it over to here now frame 60.

03:00.510 --> 03:02.480
Let's take a look at that.

03:02.580 --> 03:05.100
So it looks like here's the X now.

03:05.400 --> 03:12.510
And I'm going to press control and middle mouse button and kind of drag up just so I can see the curve

03:12.540 --> 03:14.400
a little better.

03:14.400 --> 03:20.760
So you can kind of see what's happening it's kind of curving up a lot here and then it kind of angles

03:20.760 --> 03:24.240
down a little bit differently at the end.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.760
Let's see if we can get this to work a little better.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.850
What we need is for this curve to look a little more like this curve.

03:31.860 --> 03:37.380
So it so it flows into it a little better from the back.

03:37.380 --> 03:45.670
So if this is flowing into this and repeating we want this keyframe to look similar to this keyframe.

03:45.720 --> 03:54.450
So if I select this keyframe I can click this handle here and move it around like this and try and get

03:54.450 --> 03:59.690
that curve to match up a little better.

03:59.730 --> 04:01.260
See how that works.

04:01.260 --> 04:01.980
I'll hit play

04:05.940 --> 04:13.730
a little bit better if I go back to frame 30 and move this down some more even half.

04:13.930 --> 04:17.090
And it kind of stretches it up a bit.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.760
Let's see how this works.

04:24.170 --> 04:28.850
Little too much but still you can see you can see the effects of it though.

04:28.850 --> 04:34.940
I'm going to I'm going to select this and hit the G key and the Y key and just move it down in the y

04:34.940 --> 04:37.850
axis here something like this.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.540
I'll just this a bit with the G key.

04:43.410 --> 04:45.120
Just to try and get that curve.

04:45.120 --> 04:55.710
So it looks about the same on both sides and we go that's all I wanted just a little bit of a tilt down

04:55.710 --> 05:03.000
with the head as the chest comes back and once again I can move this up a bit g y and move it up a bit

05:03.000 --> 05:06.330
to make it a little bit more pronounced.

05:09.360 --> 05:15.750
If we play the animation to me it looks like he begins breathing and then the head comes down.

05:15.750 --> 05:20.790
And that's because we've got this kind of bow in the graph right here.

05:21.240 --> 05:29.330
And what I'd like to do is have it come straight or more straight from the first key frame to the middle.

05:29.370 --> 05:35.550
It's a small thing but I thought it would be a good opportunity to talk about tangents and free tangents

05:35.560 --> 05:38.150
so let's take a look at this.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.470
I'm going to come over here and select that first key keyframe for the head.

05:43.650 --> 05:51.240
And you can see on the x axis here and I can select just this handle and press the G key and then I

05:51.240 --> 05:59.560
can move that handle So now that curve goes up more straight to the middle keyframe.

05:59.580 --> 06:05.400
All right so let's do that with this one over here if I take this one over here and I select this handle

06:05.400 --> 06:06.630
and I press the G key.

06:06.630 --> 06:10.350
You can see that it turns that other one as well.

06:10.890 --> 06:13.940
And I don't really want that per say.

06:13.980 --> 06:20.200
Let's say there's another keyframe over here and I don't want to angle that curve up or down.

06:20.370 --> 06:25.950
What I can do is I can actually break or free this particular handle from the movement of the other

06:25.950 --> 06:26.740
one.

06:26.790 --> 06:35.640
So if I select the keyframe come down here to Key I've got handle type and now I can choose free so

06:35.850 --> 06:39.750
if I just select that keyframe and hit the the key.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.990
Now I can choose free.

06:42.150 --> 06:49.350
And now if I select that one handle I can move it independently of the other handle and that's can be

06:49.350 --> 06:50.640
pretty handy.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.480
In fact I use that all the time.

06:52.830 --> 06:57.110
So let's get this right about here let's say.

06:57.240 --> 07:07.370
Now if we go back and play that that head is moving at the same time as the chest.

07:07.490 --> 07:09.260
So that helped.

07:09.260 --> 07:14.360
And then I could maybe tweak a little bit more here but I think generally that's pretty good.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.300
All right.

07:15.530 --> 07:22.310
Well there are of course other things we could do we could have him look around we could have him move

07:22.310 --> 07:25.970
his feet back and forth then swing the hammer.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.370
We could do just about anything.

07:27.380 --> 07:31.490
But this is just a very basic idle sequence.

07:31.520 --> 07:36.820
So in the next video we'll begin working on the run cycle for the character.

07:36.830 --> 07:37.470
See you then.
