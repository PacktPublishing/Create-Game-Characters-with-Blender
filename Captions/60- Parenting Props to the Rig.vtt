WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:05.650
That I realize that we've got a couple of more things that we need to do before we're done rigging the

00:05.650 --> 00:06.680
character.

00:06.820 --> 00:15.370
Now in the original design for this character I had a hammer and a shield and I've already modeled and

00:15.370 --> 00:16.120
textured those.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.850
I just need to bring them in.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.140
And then parent them to the rig.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.230
So let's do that.

00:22.390 --> 00:22.690
All right.

00:22.690 --> 00:30.550
So first of all I've got a hammer here I'm going to go over to file and append and I want to append

00:30.610 --> 00:33.470
a new object into the scene.

00:33.670 --> 00:40.480
So when I click on this object you can see I get a list of possible things I could import I could import

00:41.230 --> 00:50.290
material or I could import an object or a world or a scene or whatever but I'm going to import an object

00:50.290 --> 00:54.880
here and when I click on object I can see the name of the object.

00:54.940 --> 00:56.520
So I'm ominous like that.

00:56.650 --> 01:00.640
And then I'm just going to come over here and click append from a library.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.330
And that brings it into the scene and there it is.

01:03.370 --> 01:05.740
It's huge.

01:06.010 --> 01:09.760
I'm going to de-select it and select it again.

01:09.790 --> 01:11.180
There it is.

01:11.200 --> 01:19.050
So now I need to scale it down a bit and put it into place so I'll hit the key and scale it down so

01:19.120 --> 01:23.140
you can see it's pretty big compared to the character.

01:23.510 --> 01:28.150
I'm going to press the End key to bring up the properties panel and come over here.

01:28.160 --> 01:36.560
And for the scale I've tested this out before in it and it seemed to me like a scale of about point

01:36.650 --> 01:42.640
0 5 to 5 or something like that was pretty good.

01:42.650 --> 01:44.220
Let's try that.

01:44.270 --> 01:51.950
I'm going to also Press Control alt and Q and that will bring up the quad view so I can see this from

01:52.820 --> 01:55.350
different angles.

01:55.370 --> 02:02.870
Let me bring this down here like this and I'm going to try and just put it in his hand or turn it.

02:02.870 --> 02:05.380
So it's in line with the hand.

02:05.450 --> 02:10.910
Actually one thing I should do is I'm going to move the pivot point about where he's going to be holding

02:10.910 --> 02:11.140
it.

02:11.180 --> 02:14.390
I think it will be easier to move around if I do that.

02:14.390 --> 02:22.860
So in a press control alt cue again to get out of that quad view and I'll move the cursor with shift

02:22.880 --> 02:26.790
s to the selected object.

02:27.990 --> 02:34.350
And then I'm going to come up here with the key to open up the properties panel and if I scroll down

02:34.380 --> 02:41.610
I've got this 3D cursor X Y Z fields and I'm just going to click and drag on the Z and you can see I

02:41.610 --> 02:45.930
can just move that cursor right up and down along the hammer.

02:45.930 --> 02:47.970
So I think maybe it's going to hold it.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.610
Right about here let's say.

02:52.280 --> 02:59.330
Now I want to move the origin of the object to that 3D cursor and there we go.

02:59.340 --> 03:06.970
Now when I go back to control alt cue and rotated a bit it'll rotate.

03:06.970 --> 03:18.610
At that point now so here's the trick is to try and get it to be in his hand in a relatively believable

03:18.610 --> 03:19.340
way.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.980
Now that I've got it here I want to spin it around.

03:23.980 --> 03:29.130
I want to rotate it so the angle of the hammer is kind of in line with the arm.

03:29.290 --> 03:36.000
But if I tried to do that here in global mode that would throw it off.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.210
I think so I'm gonna switch to local mode.

03:39.810 --> 03:46.230
And now when I spin it I should be able to spin it right in line like that.

03:46.230 --> 03:47.940
So I'm going to spin it.

03:47.940 --> 03:51.250
So it's in line with his arm like that.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.520
All right control cue.

03:54.170 --> 04:01.150
And let's see if we can now adjust the fingers to wrap around the handle.

04:01.410 --> 04:09.330
So I want to press the period key on the numpad and zoom in to the handle here or to the hammer.

04:09.800 --> 04:17.250
And I'm going to choose a control object for the rig here and it's already in PPOs mode and that's good.

04:17.390 --> 04:23.090
But what I want to do is come over here to this armature panel and turn on x ray just so I can see the

04:23.090 --> 04:25.360
controls through the character.

04:25.840 --> 04:32.300
I think I want maybe let's begin with this joint and I'm going to just move the thumb out a bit.

04:33.750 --> 04:46.230
And then maybe I'll scale it in with this control like that see how that works and then let's work on

04:46.290 --> 04:47.520
these fingers here.

04:47.520 --> 04:55.660
Now if I took all of these controls like that all of them at the same time and then click and drag and

04:56.190 --> 04:57.930
I could rotate those.

04:57.930 --> 05:06.340
But it's kind of going through the handle I may have that a little bit too close and see what I can

05:06.340 --> 05:08.840
do here I think I'll bring it down just a little bit.

05:09.910 --> 05:14.670
All right I'll try that again so I can bring him in just a little bit here.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.910
And then if I select all of these controls

05:21.960 --> 05:29.620
and then scale these in the key and scale these in all right I think we've got the hammer pretty well

05:29.620 --> 05:30.770
in place.

05:30.790 --> 05:33.960
Let's go ahead and parent it to the rig.

05:34.130 --> 05:40.090
Now how do we get this hammered to stay with the hand wherever it goes.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.770
The way we can do that is to parent it to one of the bones.

05:43.990 --> 05:52.780
And if we look at the vertex groups of the character here I just select the character.

05:52.780 --> 05:55.270
Let me bring this up here.

05:55.330 --> 06:01.510
You can see that the Virtex groups all begin with DPF and that's for the deformed bones.

06:01.510 --> 06:09.580
Now all of the vertex groups were generated from the bones from the form bones when the rig was being

06:09.580 --> 06:10.640
created.

06:10.660 --> 06:15.830
So we've now we've got deformed bones in there we can't see them at this point in time.

06:15.850 --> 06:18.880
They hit the Z key you can see they're hidden away.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.350
So how do we find them.

06:22.870 --> 06:27.720
Well let's come up here to the outliner an in the outliner.

06:27.720 --> 06:37.220
I'm going to use the search tool and if I type in appear DPF and I'll do a dash.

06:37.220 --> 06:42.430
We can see we've got a lot of bones here that begin with T.F..

06:42.620 --> 06:49.400
What we're looking for is the form hand left and there it is right there.

06:49.800 --> 06:57.240
So when I select that the armature panel comes up down here and you can see there's a little orange

06:57.390 --> 07:03.670
dot here telling us that that's the layer that that bone is in.

07:03.810 --> 07:07.200
And the reason why we can't see it is because that layer isn't selected.

07:07.200 --> 07:15.810
So if I press shift and click that layer you can now see the form bones and that's the bone right there

07:15.810 --> 07:18.580
that we want to parent this hammer to.

07:18.610 --> 07:27.800
So let's select the hammer shift select that bone and then press control p.

07:28.250 --> 07:34.230
And we want to set the parent to the bone so we click that.

07:34.230 --> 07:44.940
Now if I select that hand I.K. control and if I move that around you can see that I will move the hammer

07:45.000 --> 07:45.760
as well.

07:47.000 --> 07:47.910
There we go.

07:48.140 --> 07:48.590
All right.

07:48.590 --> 07:53.280
I'm going to press shift and click this layer once again to hide those again.

07:54.290 --> 07:57.310
Now we need to bring in our shield.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.830
So let's work on that.

07:59.870 --> 08:10.420
I'm going to do the same thing here by going to a file and append and this time instead of the hammer.

08:10.700 --> 08:21.910
I want the shield so I click that go to object select the shield object and append and there it is.

08:21.980 --> 08:24.200
And it once again is huge.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.600
So now we got to go through the same process.

08:26.600 --> 08:33.370
The problem is is while moving the shield here I need to think about what I want to do.

08:33.380 --> 08:42.170
I'm not sure if I want to parent this shield to the forearm bone or if I want to parent it to the hand

08:42.170 --> 08:42.680
bone.

08:42.680 --> 08:46.830
I'm going to have issues either way and I'll show you what I mean.

08:46.910 --> 08:51.100
But in the meantime I'm going to go ahead and move this into place.

08:51.200 --> 08:58.220
I'm going to go back to the quad view with control alt cue and kind of move this into place.

08:58.220 --> 09:05.700
We're going to need to scale it down some it's more like an umbrella than a shield here.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.210
Let's see how this works.

09:10.050 --> 09:16.260
I kind of want it to be a little bit smaller than the distance up to his arm or I kind of want it to

09:16.260 --> 09:18.500
be.

09:18.900 --> 09:22.070
I don't want to overlap that shoulder armor here.

09:22.740 --> 09:31.060
I'll select these finger controls and scale these in to try and wrap the fingers around that strap there.

09:33.360 --> 09:37.490
And also the thumb as well I think I can maybe let's try that.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.860
Let's go ahead and scale that and see what happens.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.500
And just not them.

09:42.680 --> 09:50.600
All right so what I meant about trying to figure out what bone to parent it to is that no matter what

09:51.050 --> 09:58.490
I do I think I'm going to be dealing with some counter keying or having to move the arm and then rotate

09:58.490 --> 10:03.050
the shield or the hand or something to get it to work together.

10:03.050 --> 10:10.070
In other words because I've made this the way I did with these two straps it's going to be a little

10:10.070 --> 10:11.950
bit difficult to control.

10:12.140 --> 10:20.330
Now had I created the rig from scratch I may have created the bone structure of the forearm and the

10:20.330 --> 10:22.210
hand kind of is all one piece.

10:22.220 --> 10:26.400
I wouldn't have to deal with this but let's give this a try.

10:26.420 --> 10:30.190
I'm going to open this up and see if I can find the forearm.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.700
Let me see if I just type in F here.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.370
Our.

10:35.900 --> 10:39.190
And we go there are the four arms.

10:39.400 --> 10:45.560
So down here are the vertex groups I don't want those appear though.

10:45.710 --> 10:46.610
This is what I want.

10:46.610 --> 10:55.710
Now I'm going to select one of these on the right and that same layer lights up so all shift click that.

10:55.730 --> 10:58.360
Now I can see the bones in here.

10:58.400 --> 11:02.950
So there's the forearm one hears forearm two.

11:03.350 --> 11:05.490
And down here is the hand.

11:05.540 --> 11:11.280
So if I parroted to this forearm let's try this.

11:11.280 --> 11:18.200
I'm a parent to this bone right here so I'll select that shield shift's select that bone press control

11:18.200 --> 11:21.570
P and parent it to the bone.

11:21.570 --> 11:31.520
Now if I select that I.K. handle and hit G and move around you can see the shield comes along with the

11:31.520 --> 11:32.210
forearm.

11:32.210 --> 11:33.290
But look at the hand.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.420
So the hands a little off.

11:35.420 --> 11:43.750
So now what I mean by counter keying if that's where I want the shield to be for this particular pose.

11:43.910 --> 11:47.990
I then need to rotate the hand into place.

11:48.840 --> 11:54.600
On the shield and that may be easier said than done.

11:54.600 --> 12:03.510
See how it's the rotation of the forearm and the hand are connected through constraints I'm going to

12:03.590 --> 12:12.220
undo that a ways till I get back to where I was and nominate and parent this to unparallel press alt

12:12.220 --> 12:18.310
P and then clear parent choosing the shield and then clearing that parent.

12:18.310 --> 12:25.090
Now one thing I ought to do and what I didn't do with the hammer let me press the end key for the properties

12:25.090 --> 12:30.140
panel is to apply the the transformations.

12:30.150 --> 12:37.180
Now I've got this where I want it to be I need this to be its zero location and you can see here that

12:37.180 --> 12:42.690
it's got values in the location and the rotation and and the scale.

12:42.850 --> 12:45.040
So I need to apply those.

12:45.130 --> 12:53.060
So I'll press control a and apply the rotation and scale and then I'll press control a and apply the

12:53.060 --> 12:54.670
location.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.340
Here we go.

12:56.580 --> 13:04.490
So I I'm going to need to go back and do that for the hammer as well I think probably be a good idea.

13:04.500 --> 13:04.730
All right.

13:04.740 --> 13:08.650
So I tried this bone let's try this bone up here.

13:08.670 --> 13:10.860
This looks like it's the forearm one.

13:10.860 --> 13:13.220
So let's try this one.

13:13.360 --> 13:20.470
So I'll select the shield shift select that forearm one control P set the parent to the bone.

13:20.650 --> 13:30.030
And now let's select the hand and move it around OK well that's all right.

13:32.010 --> 13:38.020
If I wanted to move the hammer to that position now what let's see if I can get that hand in place if

13:38.020 --> 13:41.850
I press R and rotate it.

13:43.780 --> 13:45.600
A little bit like this.

13:46.380 --> 13:54.150
It appears that I can get that hand into place pretty easily that the rotation of the forearm isn't

13:54.270 --> 14:00.790
constrained at all to the hand or this particular forearm bone I should say.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.150
All right.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.840
Well that's one way to do it.

14:02.870 --> 14:03.990
Another way to do it.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.150
I'm going to undo here.

14:09.130 --> 14:17.730
Another way to do it is to parent to the hand if I select that shield press alt P to clear the parent.

14:17.780 --> 14:26.970
And now if I select the shield and shift select this bone or press control P set the parent to the bone.

14:26.970 --> 14:35.760
And now if I select that I can handle and move it around and see it's now parenting to the hand but

14:35.760 --> 14:40.660
the problem is you see look at the forearm strap there.

14:40.660 --> 14:45.080
So once again I've got some counter keying to do to get it into place.

14:45.240 --> 14:49.560
So it really depends on what I want to do here.

14:50.040 --> 14:56.490
I think for me I'm going to want to go with this bone here.

14:56.490 --> 15:03.150
I think I'm going to probably go with the forearm bone because it seems to me to be easier just to counter

15:03.190 --> 15:07.910
key the hand than the whole shield.

15:08.730 --> 15:10.650
Like this.

15:10.710 --> 15:11.310
All right.

15:11.310 --> 15:15.930
I'm going to shift select this layer here to hide those.

15:16.020 --> 15:22.250
And now I think we're about ready to animate.

15:22.540 --> 15:28.450
I'm going to come over here to the outliner real quick and delete that.

15:28.610 --> 15:33.640
So I get the list of all my objects now in the outliner.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.420
And so there's our character.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.430
We're going to begin animating them.

15:37.430 --> 15:40.130
I think the first thing we'll do is an idle.
