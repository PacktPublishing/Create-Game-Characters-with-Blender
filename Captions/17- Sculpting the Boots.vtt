00:00.780 --> 00:03.080
Well today I feel like working on the boots.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.560
I don't know why do we really need a reason.

00:05.580 --> 00:11.430
I think I'm going to just start working on one of these boots here.

00:11.490 --> 00:14.440
I don't exactly know what they look like.

00:14.490 --> 00:22.920
This drawing doesn't give me a whole lot of information but I've got some reference images of boots

00:22.980 --> 00:27.590
up on my screen around Blendr here to take a look at.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.290
And I thought I just began working on this.

00:30.570 --> 00:38.240
So first of all let's get some base geometry for the boot that we can use to sculpt on.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.390
I'm not going to sculpt directly on the character here.

00:42.390 --> 00:46.920
I want to duplicate some faces and create some new geometry.

00:47.220 --> 00:53.940
So what I'll do is I'll come back to object mode and I'll turn off the multi rez modifier for now by

00:53.940 --> 00:56.030
clicking here on the eyeball.

00:56.550 --> 01:03.230
And if we select this we can see that here is the base geometry we created at the beginning.

01:03.310 --> 01:12.270
I'm going to go to my character images view here and go to wireframe press Schiff's see to frame up

01:12.270 --> 01:14.100
the whole thing.

01:14.140 --> 01:18.270
Let's take a look at the boots down here.

01:18.270 --> 01:25.820
So it looks like if I duplicated I'm going to press the key for border select.

01:26.010 --> 01:33.760
If I duplicated all of this I could use this as the base geometry of the boot.

01:33.850 --> 01:38.270
I'm going to come back here to my default view.

01:38.340 --> 01:45.390
Now I don't need both sides of this so I'm going to go back into wireframe and just de-select everything

01:45.390 --> 01:49.970
with a hit B again and just select this one side.

01:50.010 --> 01:54.410
All right so now I'm going to duplicate this with chiff D.

01:54.540 --> 02:01.410
And now I've got duplicate faces there going to press the P key and separate those duplicate faces out

02:01.410 --> 02:02.820
into their own object.

02:02.820 --> 02:06.810
So I'll press the P key and hit selection.

02:06.960 --> 02:12.150
And now I should be able to see a new object over here.

02:12.150 --> 02:14.560
Here it is character 0 0 0 0 1.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.460
I can call this boot.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.310
And that will be what we'll use to create our boots.

02:20.310 --> 02:31.420
Now I'm going to isolate it with shift H for now and zoom in a bit and I would like to close off the

02:31.420 --> 02:31.900
top.

02:31.900 --> 02:39.160
I think it might help in the sculpting to have it all one piece so I'm going to go to edge mode press

02:39.250 --> 02:46.060
Alt click that edge to select that entire edge loop and I'm going to just hit the for extrude and click

02:46.120 --> 02:54.650
and then scale this in a bit and maybe just do easy and click and then I'll merge those together with

02:54.650 --> 02:58.550
Allt M and click at center.

02:58.560 --> 03:03.000
So now we've got that piece ready to go.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.980
All right I'll go back to object mode with Tab key press.

03:06.990 --> 03:16.860
All it takes to bring back the character and what I'd like to do is let's take this character let's

03:16.860 --> 03:27.630
reapply the multi rez modifier to him Nalut select the boot and I'm going to apply a multi rez modifier

03:27.630 --> 03:28.480
to that one.

03:28.590 --> 03:34.240
I already have it here but I don't want that sculped information on that.

03:34.410 --> 03:38.730
I just don't want that I want to begin with a new multi rez modifier.

03:38.730 --> 03:43.940
I mean if I click this and turn it on it'll be exactly the same shape as the foot.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.480
And I don't really want that.

03:45.780 --> 03:50.660
So I'm going to get rid of this modifier and I'll add a new one.

03:53.130 --> 04:01.380
And let's subdivide this oh let's first do it once here maybe twice.

04:02.210 --> 04:07.760
And we go and I'll hit smooth over here just to make sure.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.550
And so there is the beginning of our boot.

04:11.600 --> 04:17.590
Now what I need to do is just sculpt this out to match our foot.

04:17.770 --> 04:23.830
So when they come over here to the sculped mode and let's take a look at how we want to do this.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.400
Now you know what.

04:25.400 --> 04:31.700
Now that I think about it I might want to come back and adjust these points here.

04:31.820 --> 04:34.780
I think they were a little bit too high.

04:34.790 --> 04:35.870
Let me see.

04:37.170 --> 04:38.160
What we can do here.

04:38.170 --> 04:41.220
I'm going to Borders select these.

04:41.650 --> 04:46.100
And if we go back into our character images screen lay out.

04:46.390 --> 04:49.050
Yeah I want to move that down just a bit.

04:50.020 --> 04:51.470
Not like that.

04:52.110 --> 04:53.860
So back in sculped mode.

04:53.860 --> 04:58.740
Now let me take a look at these images.

04:59.120 --> 05:08.000
So what we need to do is pull this out and get it arranged so it's fitting around the foot a little

05:08.000 --> 05:09.040
bit better.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.610
Maybe I'll use my grab brush.

05:11.690 --> 05:12.860
Let's try this.

05:12.860 --> 05:19.970
We could use any number of brushes here but for now I think I'll try this.

05:20.020 --> 05:25.680
So I just want to begin pulling these out just a little bit.

05:26.350 --> 05:32.930
Actually maybe I'll begin with the scope draw so I can see it a little bit better.

05:32.940 --> 05:40.340
And just began bringing this out just a little bit like this

05:43.830 --> 05:49.640
continue a little bit more with the grab brush here just trying to pull it out and getting it ready

05:49.650 --> 05:52.770
getting at the proper shape here.

05:54.630 --> 05:59.180
Now one thing I could do is turn on x ray for the boot here.

05:59.430 --> 06:00.450
Let's try that.

06:00.450 --> 06:10.120
I'm going to come over here and go to this object panel and if I scroll down and choose x ray you can

06:10.120 --> 06:14.910
see I can kind of see it through the object here.

06:15.470 --> 06:22.560
So I can kind of play with it a little bit in here and sculpt it a bit and let me go back to the grab

06:22.560 --> 06:28.860
brush now that I've got x ray on and just pull this out a bit something like that.

06:34.090 --> 06:34.780
All right.

06:34.970 --> 06:43.350
Let's actually try and turn on x ray for the for the for the body here.

06:46.190 --> 06:50.530
Let's try that turn that on.

06:50.690 --> 06:55.690
You can kind of see it works a little bit like that.

06:55.750 --> 06:56.750
It's not bad.

07:00.870 --> 07:03.830
If we know if we need it we can use that.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.540
But I'm going to go with this for now.

07:11.230 --> 07:11.740
All right

07:14.750 --> 07:19.800
and for right now I think I'll go ahead and hide the body.

07:20.030 --> 07:28.700
So I'm going to select just the boot and move it to a new layer maybe layer 3 here like that and just

07:28.700 --> 07:31.090
go to layer 3.

07:31.160 --> 07:38.350
So a couple of things I want to do I want to make the instep here punch this in just a little bit

07:45.000 --> 07:47.080
and bring this side in some two

07:49.870 --> 07:53.710
and I'll try and flatten the soul a little bit.

07:56.140 --> 07:57.630
Move out the toes.

07:59.360 --> 08:08.080
And try and get a general shape like a foot here from the bottom now that I've got a very basic rough

08:08.170 --> 08:08.770
shape.

08:08.770 --> 08:12.690
I think what I'll do is go ahead and add another subdivision here.

08:12.910 --> 08:23.100
So if I go back to the multi rez modifier I'm going to add a subdivision here maybe up to three and

08:23.100 --> 08:29.550
with that I can start maybe working on some of the wrinkles and creases in the boot because I think

08:29.550 --> 08:32.490
it's kind of leathery.

08:32.490 --> 08:39.670
I'm not exactly sure I should be I should probably be a little bit more sure of these kinds of things.

08:39.810 --> 08:49.230
But I think it's somewhat leathery so I'm going to begin just laying down what could be wrinkles along

08:49.230 --> 08:50.950
these areas here.

08:51.030 --> 08:55.170
Still not enough subdivision let me give it one more.

08:55.520 --> 09:03.450
And then we can begin getting a little bit of wrinkles here so I'm going to start by just going over

09:03.450 --> 09:11.790
the top here and I'll sculpt one normal struck by that pulls out and then I'll hold control and cut

09:11.790 --> 09:12.470
in.

09:12.690 --> 09:17.600
And then another one that comes out and then control to cut it in.

09:17.640 --> 09:24.560
So just kind of using that method to try and get something that looks like wrinkles here.

09:31.280 --> 09:39.600
And as I said I do have several images of boots up on my screen to try and keep track of what I'm doing.

09:39.620 --> 09:47.540
I'm not using any particular one just using them as kind of a guideline.

09:47.540 --> 09:54.620
Now as you work on something like this you can actually change the way the stroke lays down on the object.

09:54.620 --> 10:02.900
So if I come over here to curve and I'm in this sculped draw brush now I can change the way the curve

10:03.230 --> 10:09.470
happens so this is like the top of the stroke and this is the side and down at the bottom of the stroke

10:09.470 --> 10:16.010
so we can change how this happened so I can just show you what I mean if I stroke here you can see that

10:16.010 --> 10:20.160
we're getting that kind of bell curve to the stroke.

10:20.210 --> 10:26.570
If I do that and I come back over here to say just this and make it flat you can see we're getting more

10:26.570 --> 10:27.680
of a flat stroke.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.890
Now it's hard to see without more subdivisions on it.

10:30.890 --> 10:33.410
Let me just add one here.

10:33.410 --> 10:35.380
There you can see that's more flat.

10:35.580 --> 10:37.090
Right.

10:37.190 --> 10:41.520
If we do this one say it'll be more curved.

10:41.750 --> 10:48.920
So you can really get a different kind of stroke from playing with these different curves.

10:48.920 --> 10:54.510
You can also just take one and drag it around and make one of your own too.

10:54.950 --> 10:58.410
And I'm going to think about I'm thinking about these straps now.

10:58.550 --> 11:04.760
I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do with these if I'm going to build these external geometry around

11:04.880 --> 11:13.520
the boot or if I can use something like this sculpt draw a brush with this flat curve and maybe just

11:13.520 --> 11:15.050
hint at it like this.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.660
I'm not sure if that's going to be possible.

11:18.680 --> 11:25.920
I mean I could just come around like this and build it up like that.

11:26.960 --> 11:36.980
So it gets the hint of a strap but it's not really giving me those sharp edges that I'd want if I increase

11:36.980 --> 11:41.630
the subdivision even more up here like this and tried this.

11:41.660 --> 11:46.610
I might get a little bit more edge to it but it's kind of rough.

11:46.610 --> 11:54.900
I'm not sure that I want to do that and I could flatten it I guess and I could also use the pinch tool

11:55.620 --> 12:01.090
to pinch the edges like this.

12:01.300 --> 12:08.710
So that's something to think about I could maybe build up all of the straps in this way and maybe I'll

12:08.710 --> 12:09.340
work on that.

12:09.340 --> 12:12.550
I think I'll do a few more tests to see.

12:12.550 --> 12:18.670
And this is sometimes what you have to do just kind of test one way or another to see what's going to

12:18.670 --> 12:25.640
be more efficient or more interesting realistic whatever you're looking for.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.820
So I hope that's been helpful.

12:27.820 --> 12:33.700
I'm sure having fun creating this character will keep moving forward in the next videos.
