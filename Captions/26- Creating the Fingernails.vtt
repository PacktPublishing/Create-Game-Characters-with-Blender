00:00.720 --> 00:02.990
Well today I'd like to work on the hands.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.960
I think I'd like the fingernails to be more like claws.

00:08.130 --> 00:15.060
But I do want to go over how you would create just normal human fingernails first.

00:15.180 --> 00:21.530
I'll just do one like that and then I'll start on the longer claws for the character.

00:21.540 --> 00:25.600
So right now he's up five point two million tries.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.490
So as I move him around there's a bit of a delay.

00:28.530 --> 00:33.730
So what I'm going to do is come back to my layer or just the character is.

00:33.930 --> 00:41.220
So there he is and I've removed the feet because I didn't need them and they were kind of poking through

00:41.310 --> 00:43.100
the boots the way I wanted them.

00:43.140 --> 00:48.150
So I just deleted them because we're never going to see his feet.

00:48.390 --> 00:53.960
Now for the fingers here there's still a ways to go here.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.860
I'm not completely done with the fingers by any means.

00:57.860 --> 01:03.770
They're kind of chunky and flat and not really there yet.

01:03.770 --> 01:10.240
I do have a multi resolution modifier on the object here.

01:11.550 --> 01:19.170
And I do need to create some wrinkles for the top of the fingers as well as maybe creases or pads for

01:19.170 --> 01:20.780
the thumbs.

01:21.030 --> 01:23.540
So there's more work that needs to be done here.

01:23.550 --> 01:27.730
I know but let's just work on one of the fingernails for now.

01:28.290 --> 01:34.680
So with the object selected Let's go ahead and go into sculped mode over here and let me just make sure

01:34.740 --> 01:40.740
under the sculped tools that our symmetry is on and it is not.

01:40.740 --> 01:48.150
So let me turn the X mirror back on here I'm going to come up here to the sculped draw tool.

01:48.180 --> 01:55.020
Actually no let's go to the mask tool because we're going to do this just like we have for many of the

01:55.020 --> 02:01.830
other parts of the character and mask out an area for the fingernail to work with.

02:01.890 --> 02:07.790
I think I'm going to get rid of the rest of the character or at least hide it away for now.

02:08.100 --> 02:13.860
And with the H key click and drag and hide these away.

02:13.860 --> 02:21.080
This area here like that and so that will help me see what I'm doing a little bit better here.

02:21.090 --> 02:28.920
I'll also hover over one of the fingers and press alt F and that will center up the view on that finger.

02:28.920 --> 02:35.790
And now as I zoom in and rotate it will rotate around that one point.

02:35.820 --> 02:39.760
So now let's take a look at just working on this finger right here.

02:39.810 --> 02:44.460
And notice I've hidden everything except the other hand.

02:44.730 --> 02:51.900
You've got to keep the other part of the model visible if you're going to use the mirror option in the

02:51.900 --> 02:54.050
sculped tools.

02:54.060 --> 02:59.050
All right so now let's paint the area that's going to be the fingernail.

02:59.280 --> 03:10.660
So I'm going to start something like this or use the Control key to erase some over here and maybe erase

03:10.660 --> 03:15.790
a little here and let me take a look at the multi rez modify here.

03:15.790 --> 03:22.340
I could bring this up one subdivision level right now as I'm working.

03:22.510 --> 03:29.580
And that would allow me to get a little bit cleaner line on the mask.

03:29.780 --> 03:37.160
All right so there is our fingernail and what I'll do now is press control to invert the selection.

03:37.520 --> 03:43.460
And now I'll come back to maybe my inflate brush and let's increase the size here.

03:44.290 --> 03:53.310
And now I can come in and just begin to inflate the area inside the mask here.

03:54.830 --> 03:55.320
All right.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.650
Let's see if that's enough.

03:57.690 --> 04:02.690
Go ahead and press control to invert the selection again.

04:03.590 --> 04:10.070
And now what we can do is come back here and I'm going to use the sculped DRob rush for this one and

04:10.070 --> 04:18.350
I want to just sculpt in around that mask for the cuticle here so I'll just try and bring this up a

04:18.350 --> 04:18.880
bit.

04:19.970 --> 04:21.410
Around the fingernail

04:26.050 --> 04:28.790
and maybe even a little bit tighter.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.050
Right in around the mask.

04:34.730 --> 04:35.750
Then what we could do.

04:35.750 --> 04:42.950
Now I'm going to go ahead and press him to clear it just to see how we're doing so him and then we've

04:42.950 --> 04:46.710
got just a hint of a fingernail there so far.

04:47.060 --> 04:49.300
We could certainly do more there.

04:49.580 --> 04:54.370
So a press command easy to undo control.

04:54.470 --> 04:58.450
And I'll come back here and inflate it out just a little bit more.

05:06.700 --> 05:10.500
And now I can take this part of the thing.

05:10.510 --> 05:17.920
Now I can take the fingernail and go to my grab brush and very gently.

05:17.920 --> 05:22.720
I'm going to take this and I'm just going to move it up just a little bit up into the cuticle see how

05:22.720 --> 05:23.490
this works.

05:23.500 --> 05:29.220
So I click and drag and just move it up and tighten it up around the cuticle just a little bit.

05:29.320 --> 05:38.140
And I'll also come in here now just smooth back that piece that's going to go up under the cuticle some.

05:38.140 --> 05:38.500
All right.

05:38.500 --> 05:45.690
So if we then remove the mask by pressing alt M and see that we've got the beginnings of a fingernail

05:45.700 --> 05:55.490
here I can move this skin area up a bit to kind of collapse it up into the fingernail and smooth some

05:55.490 --> 06:03.090
of that back but you can see you can get a general fingernail kind of kind of a look from that.

06:03.090 --> 06:11.270
Now I'd rather have a claw type fingernail on this character if we go back and take a look at the reference

06:11.270 --> 06:12.170
images.

06:12.180 --> 06:18.620
You can see we have kind of claws for the character so I think instead of doing it this way I'd like

06:18.620 --> 06:26.090
to actually work on building out and inserting in a claw.

06:26.090 --> 06:34.610
So I think what I'll do is just actually work on one in its own layer build up using polygon modeling

06:34.910 --> 06:37.000
and then bring it up and put it into place.

06:38.220 --> 06:45.670
So I'm going to come over here to a new layer now I've found a couple of reference images that I think

06:45.670 --> 06:47.150
I can use.

06:47.150 --> 06:50.050
Let me open up U-V Ed. here

06:52.940 --> 06:58.850
and bring in that reference image.

06:58.990 --> 07:00.590
Turn on the images here.

07:00.610 --> 07:05.130
And I think this one here looks pretty good to me.

07:06.880 --> 07:13.870
Just to get the basic shape of the fingernail and that's about the length I'd like them I think.

07:13.870 --> 07:20.500
I think first of all I'm just going to begin with a polygon plane and that will pop in right into the

07:20.500 --> 07:24.580
center of the grid and I will frame that up.

07:25.260 --> 07:32.640
With the period key on the numpad I think I'll turn off the mat caps hit the N key to bring up the properties

07:32.640 --> 07:37.960
panel and just turn off the cap here and hit the in key again.

07:38.310 --> 07:41.750
Now what I'd like to do is split this in half.

07:41.880 --> 07:49.770
So I'm in a tab into edit mode and go to the loop cut tool by pressing control r and I'll just hover

07:49.770 --> 07:57.750
over here and hit enter once and hit enter again and that will ensure that that edge is right down the

07:57.750 --> 08:04.350
center of that polygon so I'll hit control tab and go to face mode.

08:05.250 --> 08:08.880
And I'll select this face and I'll just delete it.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.060
I'll hit the x key and delete that face.

08:12.060 --> 08:20.580
Now I've got this half of a Polygram come over to the modifiers window click add modifier and I'll choose

08:20.580 --> 08:21.420
mirror.

08:21.660 --> 08:27.420
So now whatever I do on one side of this object will happen on the other side.

08:27.420 --> 08:35.280
So if I go into vertex mode and hit the key and move around you can see that's going to mirror it on

08:35.280 --> 08:36.370
the other side.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.920
So will Let's begin working on these nails.

08:40.920 --> 08:48.870
I think what I'm going to do is have this be the cuticle up here and it'll come down here for the nail

08:48.870 --> 08:50.100
like that.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.180
So let's give it a try.

08:51.180 --> 09:03.030
I'm just going to move this a bit like that and I will maybe extrude this out and hit the e key.

09:03.020 --> 09:07.570
Now go ahead and click and just move it out with the normal transform tool here.

09:08.610 --> 09:10.910
And maybe been that in a bit.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.380
So there we have the part that's going to go up against the cuticle.

09:15.490 --> 09:23.460
I'll go ahead and select this edge and let's just I think I'll go to the top view I'll hit the 7 key

09:23.460 --> 09:28.050
on the keyboard and hit the five key then to go into orthographic view.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.650
So I know I'm looking at it from the top.

09:31.650 --> 09:38.010
I'll hit the and click and I'll extrude down like that.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.010
Maybe one more time.

09:41.860 --> 09:43.910
And I'll bring these in just a hair.

09:47.560 --> 09:53.230
That hit me and extrude again.

09:54.390 --> 10:01.670
And now these should be getting a little bit more pointy see how this works.

10:02.220 --> 10:02.470
Yeah.

10:02.480 --> 10:09.470
So I think something like that I'll tumble around hit the five key to go back to perspective view and

10:09.470 --> 10:15.140
I'll just select this edge by pressing control and clicking on this point here and that selects that

10:15.140 --> 10:20.460
whole edge between those two points and I'll just bring it up a bit.

10:22.550 --> 10:25.210
Just so it curves a little bit

10:28.330 --> 10:35.990
like that and I'll just do a little point pulling to get this shaped more like a fingernail

10:42.070 --> 10:48.910
Well let's go ahead and put it in place and see how it's going to look actually on the character and

10:48.910 --> 10:53.280
maybe that'll help us finalize the shape of it.

10:53.320 --> 10:58.050
So I'm going to go ahead and apply the mirror or.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.510
So now it's all one piece.

11:02.340 --> 11:07.700
And let's bring back the characters who will shift click that first layer right here.

11:11.110 --> 11:19.900
This in here I've changed the transformation from global to local so that the transform manipulators

11:20.440 --> 11:22.000
are in line with the object.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.730
And then I can just slide it on like that.

11:25.300 --> 11:32.190
So now what I'd like to do is use the mask tool to mask around here.

11:33.530 --> 11:38.400
Invert the mask and then flatten this area that's underneath the nail a bit.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.950
So I'll choose the character.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.040
And let's go back into sculped mode.

11:45.400 --> 11:51.180
And I'll go to the mask to all reduce the size of the brush a bit.

11:51.990 --> 12:08.580
And I just want to paint it right around here like this.

12:08.660 --> 12:12.700
So now you can see that I'll just show that.

12:12.710 --> 12:20.930
So now you can see that I've got that area painted out and now I'll just go to the Flaten tool and let's

12:20.930 --> 12:23.080
see if I can just flatten this down a bit.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.910
I may even want to cut it in.

12:25.910 --> 12:33.510
So I'll come back to the sculpt draw a brush and press control and see if I can cut it in a bit.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.300
All right.

12:36.310 --> 12:39.750
So let's look at the fingernail again.

12:41.990 --> 12:45.720
Let's invert the selection with control.

12:47.140 --> 12:51.870
And now I'll bring that object back in just a little bit more.

12:53.580 --> 12:58.320
So and let's sculpt around that.

12:58.330 --> 13:05.340
Now now if I hit the F key get that a little bit smaller.

13:05.650 --> 13:15.460
Let's see if I can kind of Bulge the cuticle out around that fingernail a bit increased the strength

13:18.500 --> 13:19.150
and we go

13:23.460 --> 13:27.780
so now that we've kind of embedded that nail into there.

13:27.870 --> 13:35.320
What I'm going to do is probably use the solidify modifier to thicken that up.

13:35.520 --> 13:43.230
And also we'll use the sculp tools to kind of create the grain of the fingernail on there as well.

13:43.530 --> 13:46.450
So we've got two ways to create fingernails there.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.510
Of course there's more work to be done.

13:48.510 --> 13:53.730
There's a lot of cleanup and also some detail work for the wrinkles of the fingers.
