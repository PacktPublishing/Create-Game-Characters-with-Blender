00:00.920 --> 00:06.590
Well let's work on continuing the read typology of the character's head today.

00:06.890 --> 00:12.800
I'm going to go ahead and come over here to the grease pencil area over on the tool shelf and click

00:12.800 --> 00:22.150
on draw and I'd like to just extend this edge on up over the head so I'll draw one edge here.

00:24.110 --> 00:36.330
One here let's say another here and maybe a couple of more going up over to the ear

00:40.910 --> 00:49.700
maybe like so now that I've got that I'll press enter and then I'll go into edit mode and I'll select

00:49.760 --> 00:54.880
these points here these edges like that point and control click.

00:54.880 --> 01:01.790
This one just like that whole row of edges and then I'll just click add surface and there we go.

01:01.790 --> 01:09.470
Now I'm going to take the follow down to one and I'll also turn off x rays so we don't see through it.

01:10.130 --> 01:13.040
So I'll just drag these into the center real quick.

01:17.230 --> 01:24.690
And remember with clipping on over here in the mirror modifier those will snap into the center.

01:24.700 --> 01:32.320
Now one thing I'd like to do is as I extend this area back to the back of the head I would like me turn

01:32.320 --> 01:33.460
off x.

01:33.640 --> 01:41.590
I would like for these to come back and be evenly spaced so that when they come back to the back of

01:41.590 --> 01:50.110
the head we don't have some polygons wider than the others but to do them I kind of need to gently expand

01:50.110 --> 01:54.340
these here as they move toward the back.

01:54.340 --> 02:02.700
So I think what I can do is just select these points and press shift V to slide a vertex So a press

02:02.710 --> 02:11.660
shift and the V key and this slide the vertex over just a bit just to make things a little more even

02:16.200 --> 02:17.840
all right that's looking pretty good.

02:18.120 --> 02:25.140
Let's come back here to the back side again and I'll turn off the x ray and I'll begin drawing out the

02:25.140 --> 02:29.530
edges that are going to extend down to the back of the neck.

02:29.700 --> 02:46.040
I'm going to click the draw button again and this time I'll come down like this.

02:46.130 --> 02:55.560
OK so I'm going to press enter it add surface take the cross down to one take the follow down to one

02:56.190 --> 03:02.980
as well then I'll hit x ray and see how that looks like I missed one huh.

03:03.940 --> 03:09.520
What happened here is that I didn't select this edge to extend on down.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.680
But what I can do.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.910
Let me just count this one two three four five.

03:14.080 --> 03:20.440
Here's an interesting way to fix that I'm going to just going to press control r for the loop cut and

03:20.590 --> 03:24.490
I'll do one two three four five.

03:24.490 --> 03:29.340
I'll just do this and that should match up with that.

03:29.680 --> 03:35.800
Yeah I know that's cheating right but I just forgot to select that edge.

03:35.890 --> 03:39.070
So let me select these then.

03:39.980 --> 03:42.570
And these.

03:43.380 --> 03:47.610
And once we have these edges selected I'll press control.

03:48.140 --> 03:51.030
And let's come down here to bridge edge loops.

03:51.180 --> 03:57.070
So I like that and that should bridge those back together.

03:57.110 --> 04:03.740
So the problem was is I drew out the grease pencil lines but I didn't then select what Edge was going

04:03.740 --> 04:04.550
to be extruded.

04:04.550 --> 04:07.690
So it just created geometry out on its own.

04:08.730 --> 04:13.170
So now let's take a look at connecting these up around the ear.

04:13.200 --> 04:21.590
I think what I'll do is begin with this edge and kind of come down like this and try and keep in mind

04:21.620 --> 04:27.790
my edge is on the front so I'm willing to just go say here

04:31.940 --> 04:33.360
and here.

04:35.030 --> 04:39.160
And here and this one

04:42.160 --> 04:44.990
and maybe come around like that.

04:46.450 --> 04:47.730
Here we go.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.550
Well enter.

04:50.210 --> 04:55.240
Select this edge and let's see what happens at the surface.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.440
Let's take the follow down to one.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.050
And there we go.

04:59.450 --> 05:04.510
Let me connect this one up here I'll move this.

05:05.030 --> 05:13.970
And at this point in time it just begins to be a puzzle kind of how you can most efficiently arrange

05:13.970 --> 05:22.130
these polygons So they're relatively low resolution you have relatively few of them while still maintaining

05:22.130 --> 05:24.050
the basic shape of the character.

05:24.930 --> 05:28.120
Let me select these four and hit the F key.

05:28.230 --> 05:34.290
Now for this I think I'm just going to use very basic extruding just extrude these edges and move them

05:34.710 --> 05:40.970
out around this ear see how close I can get to the actual shape of the ear.

05:40.980 --> 05:45.110
So with that whole edge like that I'll just hit E and extrude.

05:45.390 --> 05:47.940
Let's see what I can do.

05:48.060 --> 05:51.320
I'm just going to move it out like this.

05:51.330 --> 06:01.600
If you scale it a bit I'll try that again and extrude bring this up scale it ends.

06:02.770 --> 06:09.840
And let's keep on going so I'll hit E and extrude scale this and some more

06:12.510 --> 06:17.360
and extrude again on up to here let's say

06:23.020 --> 06:27.270
scale this and a bit.

06:27.370 --> 06:28.950
And one last time up here

06:33.480 --> 06:34.160
all right.

06:36.900 --> 06:43.770
So what I think I'll do is I'll work on this a little bit off camera and I want to pull these in.

06:43.890 --> 06:52.420
So it matches the inside of the ear just a little bit almost like this edge and just extrude this out

06:52.420 --> 06:54.420
to get this piece right here.

07:00.700 --> 07:08.680
And I'll just merge these two points together with Allt em and maybe at center I think I'd also like

07:08.680 --> 07:13.030
to extend this edge out right here.

07:16.080 --> 07:25.300
It's like these three and extend that to their And then I'll connect these up with him and at last

07:29.440 --> 07:34.140
I'm going to draw one more line over here like this.

07:34.130 --> 07:37.680
Maybe lound and hear press enter.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.250
To edge mode and maybe I'll try these edges.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.480
Right here.

07:47.980 --> 07:52.650
And extend those follow down to one.

07:52.960 --> 07:57.710
I'd like to maybe take this edge and extend it down along the jaw bone.

07:57.850 --> 08:02.790
So if I draw this along here maybe I can extend this down

08:06.050 --> 08:08.630
to here and connect those up

08:12.770 --> 08:18.710
like this.

08:18.710 --> 08:19.860
Take a look at that.

08:21.600 --> 08:27.870
So now maybe I can connect these four up like this.

08:29.830 --> 08:41.820
So I'm going to extend this one more time so I'll go to extend this like that quick add surface follow

08:41.820 --> 08:43.810
down to 1.

08:44.220 --> 08:48.550
Let's see how that works so maybe we can connect this up.

08:48.660 --> 08:54.770
I think what I will do is extend this road down one more to connect up with this.

08:55.130 --> 08:56.640
I will do that.

08:57.090 --> 09:06.820
So draw here and enter and let's go to edge mode.

09:08.370 --> 09:12.770
Select that edge and extend it on down.

09:13.830 --> 09:17.550
And then I just want to connect these up here.

09:20.050 --> 09:27.370
I think I'm going to extend this edge under the chin one more time before I extrude the neck down.

09:27.490 --> 09:40.680
So just draw that there and then select these points and extrude that around and connect these up.

09:40.730 --> 09:51.140
And at last and I better bring these back into this center so they clear up.

09:51.210 --> 10:00.280
So now what I'd like to do is begin extruding this down the neck down so I'm going to select all of

10:00.280 --> 10:05.100
this edge here and let's just begin extruding this down.

10:05.200 --> 10:11.280
I'm going to first of all do one quick extrusion here and bring this down.

10:13.020 --> 10:16.550
This and maybe extrude that in or pull it in a bit

10:20.210 --> 10:31.020
like so scale then a hair rotated a bit and will extrude down again.

10:33.400 --> 10:38.600
That well I think we've got a pretty good start on the head here.

10:38.830 --> 10:43.060
Right now we've got 239 faces in the object.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.650
Once we mirror it over we'll have around 500.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.210
That's pretty good.

10:48.670 --> 10:52.720
We're on course here to have a good number of polygons for our character.
