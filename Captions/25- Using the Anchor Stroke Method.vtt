00:00.630 --> 00:04.860
Well let's work a little more on this shoulder piece.

00:04.890 --> 00:14.490
What I'd like to do is maybe get some of this kind of edging around the shoulder plate and also try

00:14.490 --> 00:16.980
and imprint some designs on it.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.050
Kind of like this that we see here.

00:19.110 --> 00:26.360
I'd like kind of raised imprint of these kinds of designs so let's see if we can work on that.

00:26.610 --> 00:30.420
Right now I've got a subdivision surface modifier on it.

00:30.420 --> 00:38.130
I'm going to go ahead and take that off and I'm going to add a multi resolution and I'll just subdivide

00:38.130 --> 00:44.460
it always see maybe let's try five here.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.930
I will zoom in with the period key on the numpad.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.840
And here we go.

00:50.190 --> 00:53.120
I think I should probably isolate it as well.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.030
Maybe I'll just move it to a hole there or is it on it.

00:56.040 --> 00:59.930
Oh it's on it's own lair here so I'll just work with this now.

01:00.390 --> 01:07.500
So the first thing let's do is work on these ridges around the corners here around the edges to do that.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.330
I'll come back over to sculpt mode.

01:10.750 --> 01:14.450
Let's switch over to the sculpt draw brush.

01:14.460 --> 01:20.990
I don't need a texture on this so I'll just hit the X here to remove the texture.

01:21.120 --> 01:29.130
So let's see what kind of ridge we can get on this all hit the F key to shrink the size of the brush

01:29.130 --> 01:36.690
and I'll zoom in here and just do a couple of stroke tests just to see what I can get.

01:36.810 --> 01:40.190
I'll just google along here.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.210
It's not bad.

01:41.220 --> 01:43.570
I think I needed to be a little bit stronger.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.440
Let me increase the strength here.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.810
And I'll try this.

01:48.610 --> 01:49.820
That's pretty good.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.940
I like that.

01:51.190 --> 01:58.850
But let's also turn on smooth stroke so we can have a little bit smoother line.

01:59.260 --> 02:07.710
So I'll just begin here and let's try this one to begin right about here and just drag along this edge

02:12.190 --> 02:15.350
like so and see how this works.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.840
So I'll just kind of work on this around the whole piece.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.770
And see what we can come up with.

02:27.910 --> 02:35.920
Now disinter up my brush here say in this area when I'm in sculped mode I can press alt F and it will

02:35.920 --> 02:40.470
frame that up and center that point right in the center of my view.

02:40.690 --> 02:44.710
And now when I tumble around it's going to tumble at that point.

02:44.950 --> 02:54.910
So that kind of helps as you're going around a piece like this.

02:55.020 --> 03:04.230
And I think maybe I'll try another madcap so I'll press the End key on the keyboard and scroll down

03:04.230 --> 03:12.980
to the Metcalf's here and see if this one is going to help me see a little better I think this one will.

03:13.030 --> 03:15.370
So I'll go back to that one.

03:15.430 --> 03:18.650
Now I want to create this in here.

03:20.180 --> 03:25.320
I'll turn on smooth stroke again and maybe give me a little bit more of a radius there.

03:26.530 --> 03:29.980
And let's try this.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.300
I'm just going to try and do it freehand.

03:32.680 --> 03:38.070
Why not.

03:38.130 --> 03:46.110
I'll begin up here and come down and then turn and

03:54.210 --> 04:00.450
something like that now I can't tell but it looks like there may be one right down the center there.

04:00.910 --> 04:02.020
Let's do that.

04:02.050 --> 04:04.740
See if I can bring one from here.

04:06.970 --> 04:12.100
All the way down to this edge or this point see how this works.

04:17.420 --> 04:26.120
So now what I'd like to do is create some of this kind of interesting pattern work here and here and

04:26.120 --> 04:29.600
maybe down here and over here.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.940
Let's see if we can do that.

04:32.750 --> 04:40.610
So what I've done is I've gone out to Google images and I've found some tattoo designs.

04:40.970 --> 04:48.450
I just googled tattoo designs and hundreds of them came up and I just grabbed this one here.

04:48.530 --> 04:56.240
So what I want to do is make brushes for my texture brush from these designs.

04:56.240 --> 05:06.110
So I've already done one here and I've just taken the design deleted the background out of it and inverted

05:06.110 --> 05:07.080
the color.

05:07.520 --> 05:16.640
And this one I've saved out as a P and g file that I can then bring in as a texture to my brush in Blender.

05:16.640 --> 05:24.190
So the first thing I'll do is come up here to file and go to new and I've already typed in 1 0 0 0 0

05:24.260 --> 05:25.500
and by 1 0 0 0 0 0.

05:25.520 --> 05:32.870
So I'm just going to click OK to create a new document and here it is what I'll do now is come over

05:32.870 --> 05:42.860
here and go to my rectangle select tool and select and drag select one of these pieces right here say

05:42.860 --> 05:51.890
this one and all press control or command C to copy that and I'll come back here to my new document

05:52.340 --> 05:56.650
Press Control Command V to paste that in.

05:56.660 --> 06:02.450
Now once I do that you see I've got this floating selection pasted layer thing.

06:02.450 --> 06:09.310
I just need to right click and choose two new layer and that will create it as a layer.

06:09.350 --> 06:15.860
So if I turn off my background you can see I've got that white around this I need to get rid of that.

06:15.980 --> 06:22.530
So I'll just come over here to the fuzzy select tool and click in the white area.

06:22.700 --> 06:31.030
And now all I have do is just delete this and now it just leaving the black behind I'll de-select this

06:31.040 --> 06:33.440
by going to select none.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.080
You can also do shift command day.

06:36.860 --> 06:42.710
And now you can see that I've got just that design with no background here.

06:42.890 --> 06:51.850
So now I can invert this I'll select the layer that the design is on and I'll go to colors and invert.

06:52.030 --> 06:52.930
And there you are.

06:53.020 --> 06:58.240
So now we've got something that we can use as a texture for our brushes.

06:58.240 --> 07:02.620
So I'll go ahead and save this I'll save file export as.

07:02.910 --> 07:05.900
And it's going to export as a P and g here.

07:05.920 --> 07:16.030
And I've got a brushes folder in my project folder here so I'll just call this tattoo to and export

07:21.240 --> 07:21.990
and I'll do that.

07:21.990 --> 07:28.350
A couple more times with these other ones I'm not real sure which ones I want to use so I'll make a

07:28.350 --> 07:29.820
brush for each of them.

07:29.960 --> 07:37.740
I'll come back over here and I'll go to my rectangle select and I'll drag select this part right here

07:37.740 --> 07:45.990
to try and grab this and then I'll come over here to that document I already created and I'll just use

07:45.990 --> 07:47.470
this same one.

07:47.640 --> 07:51.180
I'll just paste this with control or command v.

07:51.230 --> 08:00.530
All right click Choose two new layer and I'll hide the old one like that fuzzy select tool.

08:00.530 --> 08:04.800
Click on the white part delete it.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.710
Select everything.

08:08.110 --> 08:13.780
And now I just need to invert the color and then we go.

08:13.780 --> 08:16.550
Now I can go to a file export as.

08:16.960 --> 08:22.580
And this one I'll call tattoo 3.

08:22.580 --> 08:22.930
All right.

08:22.940 --> 08:27.510
So now we have all of our designs saved out as PMG images.

08:27.680 --> 08:33.500
Let's go back to Blendr and see if we can use these for our texture brushes.

08:33.500 --> 08:33.980
All right.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.230
Back here in Blender.

08:35.270 --> 08:40.590
Let's go down to our textures area here.

08:41.440 --> 08:45.070
And let's create a new texture instead of clicking here.

08:45.070 --> 08:48.900
I'm going to go ahead and come over here to this texture area over here.

08:49.790 --> 09:01.350
And click on new and I want an image or a movie which is what it is there and I click Open and here

09:01.350 --> 09:07.620
we can come into our brushes folder and find those tattoo images.

09:07.620 --> 09:10.700
So here's that tattoo one I'll see you actually.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.180
Let me switch over to the images and see which one I want.

09:14.190 --> 09:17.300
So here are the brushes I have in here they are.

09:17.520 --> 09:26.070
I think maybe I'll begin with this one here or maybe this one and I'll try this here so I'll open the

09:26.070 --> 09:32.760
image and we can see that texture in our texture brush here.

09:32.760 --> 09:40.740
So now what I want to do is I'm going to align this kind of like this and I want to be able to lay it

09:40.740 --> 09:50.430
down using the stroke method of anchored and I want to have a fairly low strength here.

09:50.470 --> 09:59.500
So now if I press the F key you can see that I've got this image now attached to to my brush and I'll

09:59.500 --> 10:02.270
hit the escape key to get out of that for now.

10:02.350 --> 10:11.470
And as long as I have this anchored stroke method selected I can click and drag where I want this to

10:11.470 --> 10:20.290
appear so if I want the center of the image to begin say here I can click and drag and it will begin

10:20.290 --> 10:22.360
to put that image down like that.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.410
Now I didn't quite get it where I wanted it.

10:25.510 --> 10:26.870
Let me try that again.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.860
Maybe I'll do it here.

10:31.220 --> 10:37.750
You can see you can lay down these imprints of the brush.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.060
Something like that.

10:41.130 --> 10:47.130
Come over here and do the same thing again but this time it needs to go the other way.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.160
Right.

10:48.240 --> 10:55.110
So I need to have a mirror image of it because I'd like to put that mirror image of it right there.

10:55.110 --> 11:02.700
So what I can do is I can come up here to the size and offset area under whereas this is under the texture

11:03.450 --> 11:12.540
and for the y axis I can maybe put negative one in here and hit return and then maybe I'll come in here

11:12.570 --> 11:15.350
and try and do this right here.

11:16.330 --> 11:20.180
And that'll spin it around so it's the mirror image of it.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.420
And we try and get that right.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.430
And here looks like I need to redo that.

11:26.430 --> 11:28.510
Let me try that again.

11:29.260 --> 11:33.180
A little bit farther up we go.

11:35.100 --> 11:38.210
Maybe I want that one to be right about there.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.790
There we go.

11:41.320 --> 11:50.290
So now you can come through with different designs and lay them down on your objects to get kind of

11:50.920 --> 11:59.030
bá relief imprint from designs you can find or make in Gimp.

11:59.200 --> 12:06.490
So I'll continue on with this and a couple of more imprints on here with the other designs I have.

12:06.490 --> 12:12.550
And then in the next video I think we're going to take a look at finishing up the hands the claws or

12:12.550 --> 12:20.290
the long fingernail type things maybe work on the ears try and finish up the general details of the

12:20.290 --> 12:21.510
character itself.
