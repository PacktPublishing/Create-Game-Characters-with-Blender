00:00.730 --> 00:06.450
Well we've finally come to the U-V mapping portion of our character model here.

00:06.490 --> 00:13.580
I've done a couple of things since the last video I've gone ahead and made everything all one object.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.840
So if I select one part of them you can see the whole thing is selected.

00:17.840 --> 00:22.210
I've just called this entire thing low poly character.

00:22.210 --> 00:27.550
We've got a lot of other things over here and the other layers and that's fine.

00:27.550 --> 00:34.750
We don't need to worry about all that right now but I've taken all of those pieces the fingers the tunic

00:34.780 --> 00:43.320
the belt buckles everything and selected them all and press control J and join them into all one object.

00:43.380 --> 00:46.580
Now you don't have to do this as you U-V map.

00:46.630 --> 00:53.520
But ultimately I think it's going to be beneficial before we do the character rigging process.

00:53.560 --> 00:58.690
But I did this because I wanted to show you just how much you can break apart and put your character

00:58.690 --> 01:01.780
back together as you U-V map.

01:01.780 --> 01:03.490
So there are two tools.

01:03.520 --> 01:09.610
One is edge split and one is remove doubles that use a lot as the map.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.480
And let me just show you what I mean here.

01:11.770 --> 01:19.810
If I zoom in to say this glove piece here and I'm a tab into edit mode if I hover over this glove and

01:20.050 --> 01:29.170
press the key you can see it selects the entire connected or linked piece of the glove and the arm and

01:29.170 --> 01:31.060
the torso and the straps.

01:31.150 --> 01:34.040
Those are all one piece of the object.

01:34.210 --> 01:42.070
But if I just wanted to focus on this glove what I could do is I could actually select this edge here

01:42.070 --> 01:43.560
with Allt click.

01:43.690 --> 01:47.710
And then I could go to Control E and choose edge split.

01:48.100 --> 01:56.230
And what that'll do now is if I hover over this glove again and press the key it'll only select that

01:56.230 --> 01:57.310
piece.

01:57.310 --> 02:06.100
Now I could do things like use Shift h to isolate that and I can just concentrate on this one piece

02:06.100 --> 02:11.670
of the model while I'm U-V mapping now to bring everything back I can choose Alt.

02:11.710 --> 02:12.650
H.

02:12.790 --> 02:19.510
And then in the end if I want to connect these pieces back together which I think will be good when

02:19.510 --> 02:23.740
we get to the rigging and skinning stage.

02:23.740 --> 02:29.800
What I can do is just hit the Z key to go to wireframe and I'm going to go to vertex mode and I can

02:29.800 --> 02:35.950
press the control key and click and drag to lasso these points.

02:36.280 --> 02:44.200
And now if I go to Control V for the vertex menu I can choose remove doubles and that will just take

02:44.200 --> 02:50.590
any two vertices that are right on top of each other and merge them into one.

02:50.610 --> 02:53.730
So now it says removed 10 vertices.

02:53.730 --> 03:01.080
Now if I come back and hover over this glove I can press the L key again and it will select that whole

03:01.080 --> 03:02.570
piece.

03:02.610 --> 03:09.970
So that's kind of the process I use to break things apart and put them back together as I U.V. map.

03:09.990 --> 03:10.290
All right.

03:10.290 --> 03:15.920
So let's now take a look at what we would like to U-V map first.

03:16.080 --> 03:19.380
For me I like to do the easiest thing first.

03:19.380 --> 03:23.220
I know people tell you you know get the hard stuff out of the way.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.150
I don't believe in that when it comes to 3D work.

03:26.390 --> 03:33.360
What I like to do for something like this is begin with the absolute simplest part first and then move

03:33.360 --> 03:34.750
toward the complex.

03:34.890 --> 03:39.720
And then by the time you get to the end of the process you've had a lot of practice.

03:39.750 --> 03:45.270
So now when you get to the complex parts you're better at it and can do it better.

03:45.300 --> 03:49.720
I may be completely fooling myself about this but this is the way I work.

03:49.950 --> 03:58.810
So for me I think the easiest part of this would be these little buckles on the belt and the strap.

03:58.860 --> 04:04.840
So what I'm going to do is go to my U.V. editing screen layout up here.

04:06.200 --> 04:14.380
And over in this window I'll press the period key to zoom into that belt buckle the U.V. editing view

04:14.380 --> 04:20.160
by default has this kind of ghost image shading and I'm not a big fan of this.

04:20.170 --> 04:26.620
I'm just going to come down here and turn this off and I go now to see all of this I'm going to go ahead

04:26.620 --> 04:29.790
and hide everything else I'm going to press shift H.

04:30.190 --> 04:39.100
And that will hide everything but this and I think I want to split this piece off from the rest of the

04:39.100 --> 04:40.000
object.

04:40.300 --> 04:47.200
So what I'm going to do is create a seam along this edge so I press alt and click that edge to select

04:47.200 --> 04:51.090
that entire edge loop and I'll press control E..

04:52.030 --> 04:54.750
And choose Marxian.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.870
Now that seam has been created there.

04:57.950 --> 05:05.640
When I use the map that is when I unwrap it those two parts will be broken out as two separate islands

05:05.720 --> 05:07.200
over here in the U-V map.

05:08.720 --> 05:13.190
So to unwrap this I'll select everything by pressing the a key.

05:13.190 --> 05:20.980
I'll bring up the U-V mapping menu by pressing the U key and then I'll just click unwrap and there it

05:20.980 --> 05:22.210
is.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.210
So there is our first U-V map.

05:25.210 --> 05:32.210
Now we can turn on this little stretched view right here and that will give us this blue shading.

05:32.350 --> 05:40.300
And it basically tells us that anything that is dark blue is not stretched and anything that's red or

05:40.300 --> 05:43.020
moving towards red is stretched.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.960
So you can see we've got some stretching here.

05:46.110 --> 05:50.620
It may not be a bad thing but we probably want to test it and see.

05:50.680 --> 05:58.630
So to test this to see if this is going to work for us we need to apply a test texture or test pattern

05:59.110 --> 06:05.380
to the object so we can see if there's any stretching and to do that we've got to apply a material to

06:05.380 --> 06:06.460
the object.

06:06.460 --> 06:09.960
So let's go and create a new window here.

06:09.960 --> 06:15.430
I'm just going to click on this upper corner right here and click and move that down.

06:15.430 --> 06:23.710
So we get a new window and I'm going to change this one from the U-V editing view to a node editor.

06:24.150 --> 06:32.210
Now right up front I want to point out that I've got the cycles a render engine chosen here by default

06:32.220 --> 06:38.280
I believe Blendr still opens up with the Blendr internal engine you just need to come up here and click

06:38.280 --> 06:45.630
on this menu and choose cycle's render and that will make sure that your note editor looks the same

06:45.630 --> 06:47.050
as mine here.

06:47.070 --> 06:53.640
So now we need to create a material for our object so here's where we can create a new material I'll

06:53.640 --> 07:02.490
just click that and I'll call this test pattern and you can see it's created two nodes in the node.

07:02.500 --> 07:07.190
Editor one for the material and one for the diffuse shader.

07:07.210 --> 07:14.220
Now I need to create a texture to be applied to that shader So when it come down here and create a new

07:14.280 --> 07:21.630
image or a new texture so click this and now I get this window and I'm going to go ahead and call this

07:21.630 --> 07:28.950
texture the same thing pattern I want to call it test pattern 10:24 by 10:24 is fine for now and I'm

07:28.950 --> 07:34.160
going to change the type from blank to the grid.

07:34.170 --> 07:41.490
Now if I click OK it will create this checker pattern for me that I can use to test how much stretching

07:41.490 --> 07:43.200
is happening on my object.

07:43.200 --> 07:51.330
So to add that texture appear in the note editor I just need to go to add texture and image texture

07:52.620 --> 07:56.070
and it's just here it is and I just click to drop it.

07:56.070 --> 08:01.590
Now I need to choose that texture and I'll just click on the little browse menu and you can see here

08:01.590 --> 08:04.410
I have the test pattern right here.

08:05.150 --> 08:11.810
I'll choose that and then I just need to connect the color channel from the image texture to the color

08:11.810 --> 08:14.480
channel of the diffuse shader.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.460
And then we have our basic node set up for our material.

08:18.470 --> 08:18.680
All right.

08:18.680 --> 08:24.700
Now I still can't see it over here and all we need to do is switch from solid view to texture.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.260
And there we go.

08:27.260 --> 08:35.700
Now we can see what it looks like and it looks like to me we've got some stretching along here and that

08:36.210 --> 08:40.490
makes sense because we were seeing kind of a light blue around the edge here

08:43.260 --> 08:47.520
so to alleviate that kind of stretching.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.220
Let's try one more thing.

08:49.420 --> 08:56.250
Let's try adding seam right along this edge almoner press control the mark seam.

08:56.710 --> 09:04.530
And now if I select everything and press you and on unwrap see what happens there I've still got that

09:04.680 --> 09:05.850
pulling there.

09:05.850 --> 09:07.390
So there's one more thing I can do.

09:07.620 --> 09:13.230
I can come down here and choose one more edge down here and break this apart.

09:13.230 --> 09:18.570
This cylindrical piece break this apart so it lays out flat.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.840
So I'll press control key and mark a seam there.

09:22.920 --> 09:30.670
Now if I select everything and press you and unwrap and where we go now it takes this cylindrical part

09:30.690 --> 09:34.340
right around here and lays it all out flat.

09:34.770 --> 09:40.470
And now that's nice and blue meaning there's very little stretching to it and that's good.

09:40.470 --> 09:41.390
That's what we want.

09:43.370 --> 09:44.060
All right.

09:44.060 --> 09:45.860
So there is our first piece.
