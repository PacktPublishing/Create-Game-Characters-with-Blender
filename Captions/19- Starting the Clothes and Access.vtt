00:00.900 --> 00:06.270
Well let's keep working on the clothes and accessories of the character.

00:06.270 --> 00:16.280
I think maybe I'll work on the belt and arm band cuff thing and maybe a little tunic toga thing.

00:16.580 --> 00:20.750
Let's just see what we can get done today for the belt.

00:20.760 --> 00:30.440
I think what I'll do is just create a new cylinder and put that on here so I'll just go to create cylinder.

00:30.480 --> 00:40.710
I'll go ahead and keep it at 30 two vertices here but I'll change the cap filled to nothing.

00:40.710 --> 00:44.930
And let me just drag this up and I'll try and put it in place here.

00:44.930 --> 00:51.750
I'm going to switch to the character images screen lay out and I'll just take that cylinder and move

00:51.750 --> 00:54.920
it up it kind of into place here.

00:55.860 --> 01:04.020
And let's just use the scale tool to kind of get it to size so I'll go to the scale tool and just move

01:04.020 --> 01:12.270
this out a bit and scale this out some here and I just want to try and get this in place as the upper

01:12.270 --> 01:21.060
part of the little Toga thing here and I'll switch into vertex mode and just hit the B key for border

01:21.060 --> 01:30.540
select and grab that bottom edge and now just move it up a bit and let's try and just extrude down to

01:30.540 --> 01:35.580
get this piece of clothing shaped up a bit.

01:35.820 --> 01:40.090
So here we all do that pull these in.

01:40.180 --> 01:49.540
Now I'll just extrude and shape that as we go so I hit the key and move down.

01:51.400 --> 01:58.650
Scale out just a hair here and here and then me and keep on going down here.

01:58.890 --> 02:04.160
Well just two maybe two more extrusions.

02:04.220 --> 02:08.450
So there you go there's the beginning of that little tunic piece.

02:08.450 --> 02:15.200
So to create those panels on the front and back I think what I'll try is selecting faces here.

02:15.200 --> 02:26.600
I want to hit the C for the circle select tool and maybe select something like this from this.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.920
Why don't I duplicate this press shift D and click.

02:31.190 --> 02:36.310
And then I'll press the P key to separate the selection out.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.110
Now it's its own object.

02:39.080 --> 02:47.090
And then when I can do is just going to bring this forward just a hair here and now what I need to do

02:47.090 --> 02:49.270
is get that shaped.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.530
So it has that kind of look to it here.

02:52.640 --> 03:01.250
So I'm going to go into edge mode and I'll just select these edges down here and I just want to extrude

03:01.250 --> 03:02.220
this out.

03:04.060 --> 03:15.010
Once it comes down a little bit farther than that original piece or maybe easy and just pull this down

03:15.010 --> 03:17.410
like this.

03:17.590 --> 03:18.030
All right.

03:18.030 --> 03:23.580
So there's that piece and it looks like it will need to be shaped a bit.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.750
I don't know how much I should do right now but I could pull these in a bit.

03:32.950 --> 03:40.540
Like so expand those out and I want to do the same thing on the back as well here.

03:44.950 --> 03:53.200
So I'll duplicate with shifty and then I'll press the key to separate that selection out for its own

03:53.200 --> 04:01.400
object and then select it and we pull it out of hair and we go.

04:01.450 --> 04:07.950
And as I did before I'm just going to select these edges and extrude them down.

04:13.110 --> 04:16.900
All right so we have the little Toga piece What about the belt.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.000
Now we ought to work on that.

04:19.440 --> 04:27.370
I'll come over to the Create tab once again and I'll just create another cylinder and we can use the

04:27.370 --> 04:34.800
same settings we used before I believe 32 vertices and no capful And let's just do the same thing here.

04:34.990 --> 04:40.240
Bring this up and I'll get the Z to go to wireframe here.

04:40.630 --> 04:47.600
And let's just try and fit this around the character again.

04:50.250 --> 04:54.780
I'll go to my character images again and let's try and place this

05:00.880 --> 05:06.890
how about the arm bands Let's take a look at those all go into edit mode.

05:06.970 --> 05:17.380
It looks like we can select faces along here so I'm going to press the C key and just drag select these

05:17.380 --> 05:18.730
faces.

05:19.370 --> 05:21.660
Maybe even come up here for now.

05:22.500 --> 05:30.200
Also select these here and those and these faces as well.

05:31.970 --> 05:39.560
All right so that looks pretty good as kind of the base geometry of that arm band.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.450
It may be too high up will have to bring it down.

05:42.860 --> 05:47.600
There's some extra geometry here that we don't need but for the most part I think we can just duplicate

05:47.630 --> 05:50.110
this and be and be good with it.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.980
Let me select this here.

05:52.040 --> 05:58.850
All right let's give this a try I'm going press shift D and then I'm going to press the P key to separate

05:58.850 --> 06:00.600
that selection.

06:00.650 --> 06:07.730
Now that it still has that multi resolution modifier on it so we don't want that.

06:07.770 --> 06:13.670
Go ahead and go into the modifiers tab and remove that modifier.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.120
So that's what we get.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.810
And I think I'll maybe come over here and choose x ray so I can see it.

06:20.090 --> 06:25.360
And now it's just a matter of adjusting and shaping this.

06:25.430 --> 06:32.510
I think I'll also add an edge loop here and I'll probably need to do this quite a bit and just expand

06:32.510 --> 06:37.760
this out a bit maybe even just scale the whole thing out.

06:38.350 --> 06:40.810
So it fits around the hand a little bit better

06:43.710 --> 06:46.490
and it doesn't need to be perfect at this point in time.

06:46.500 --> 06:53.170
But I just want to fiddle around the hand some.

06:53.180 --> 06:58.180
All right so there's the basic geometry of our arm band.

06:58.190 --> 07:00.410
I think that'll work out pretty well.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.980
And now let's take a look at.

07:04.250 --> 07:08.140
Well let's take a look at these little belt buckle pieces here.

07:08.180 --> 07:09.910
They're just cylinders.

07:09.950 --> 07:11.960
So that should be fairly easy.

07:11.960 --> 07:18.860
Let's take a look what I'll do is select this belt buckle and I'll press shift ass and move the cursor

07:18.860 --> 07:21.170
to that selected object.

07:21.260 --> 07:26.260
Then when I create a cylinder that should pop in the center there.

07:26.630 --> 07:37.970
And for this one maybe make it only 12 vertices and I'll give it a triangle fan for its top I will rotate

07:37.970 --> 07:39.090
it here.

07:41.310 --> 07:46.050
Looks like 90 degrees around the X right here.

07:50.610 --> 07:52.470
And I'll try and put it into place here.

07:52.480 --> 07:56.340
Now I don't need the triangle fan on the back.

07:56.340 --> 07:57.940
Just on the front.

07:57.940 --> 08:03.900
So try and get rid of that with the C key.

08:05.340 --> 08:08.580
And hit X and choose face's

08:11.630 --> 08:15.320
and I'll select that Ed and kind of move it forward here.

08:16.160 --> 08:21.800
All right so now let me turn off the x ray of that strap.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.430
We don't need that.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.580
Let's just work on this here.

08:25.640 --> 08:36.320
If I go to face mode and select these guys here I think what I can do is just hit me and then hit s

08:36.350 --> 08:41.430
to scale them and maybe hit me again and push in a bit.

08:44.240 --> 08:54.710
And maybe hit the ass I kind of want it maybe like a curved dome surface so what I'll do is call it

08:54.800 --> 09:04.220
easy and extrude out and then scale in just a hair the extrude out scale in just a hair like so.

09:06.720 --> 09:15.830
And maybe one more time and scale in and pull out just a bit like so.

09:17.740 --> 09:18.870
Yeah something like that.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.790
And then I think I want a little inset here.

09:21.790 --> 09:28.930
I don't know what it is but I'm going to scale that in and then inset it like that.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.850
So it's kind of like that.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.790
Yeah why not.

09:33.310 --> 09:37.270
And I will scale that down and put it in place here.

09:40.430 --> 09:41.340
Maybe a little bigger

09:44.560 --> 09:46.660
just as the base geometry of that.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.490
I think that will work fine.

09:48.490 --> 09:52.970
Now I'm going to probably smooth it and add edge loops to it.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.610
But I think that'll work.

09:54.910 --> 10:04.430
And I can also then have this here and take this and just duplicate it and move it up with shifty

10:07.080 --> 10:11.380
move that up to here and pull it out some.

10:11.390 --> 10:17.890
So now I'm going to be dealing with these in different ways for the little Toga thing here.

10:17.900 --> 10:25.850
I'm going to just sculpt on it and try and get some of that folds and flowing wrinkles of cloth there

10:25.880 --> 10:30.170
through sculpting for the strap here.

10:30.170 --> 10:39.230
I think what we need to do is probably use the solidify modifier to give it some thickness so we can

10:39.230 --> 10:40.000
try that.

10:40.000 --> 10:49.730
Now I'll go over to the modifiers tab here and just choose add modifier and solidify and if I do that

10:50.480 --> 11:02.520
I get this panel here and I can use the thickness setting I'm just going to click and drag to have this

11:02.520 --> 11:08.520
kind of thick and other bit you can see it can get really thick there but maybe I can pull it out to

11:08.520 --> 11:09.980
about like this.

11:10.230 --> 11:13.680
And there's going to be more adjusting that needs to be done.

11:14.850 --> 11:20.770
But you can see how you can build up the thickness of an object with that modifier.

11:21.030 --> 11:23.900
Now when I get it to the way I want it I'll just hit apply.

11:23.910 --> 11:26.880
But for now I think I'll just leave it there.

11:26.970 --> 11:33.300
So it looks like what we have left to do is this armband and the shoulder armor here and then we'll

11:33.300 --> 11:35.750
be able to work on sculpting those a bit.

11:35.760 --> 11:42.020
Once again I'm trying to get everything to the same basic detail level.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.720
Like I know the body isn't completely done yet.

11:45.720 --> 11:53.610
I really want to do more smoothing and tweaking on the body and on the ears and things like that.

11:53.760 --> 12:00.330
But I'd like to get these other pieces to about the same detail level and then refine the entire character

12:00.690 --> 12:02.110
kind of all in one go.
