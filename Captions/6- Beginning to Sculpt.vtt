WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:04.080
Well we're finally ready to begin sculpting.

00:04.100 --> 00:09.340
It's always good to spend the time to build up a solid base mass before you begin sculpting.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.450
And I think we're there I think this is pretty good.

00:12.620 --> 00:18.330
We've got the polygons of our mesh generally the same size.

00:18.350 --> 00:24.200
There are of course always going to be spotted ones up around the head but other than that generally

00:24.200 --> 00:28.590
speaking we've got them relatively proportional.

00:28.610 --> 00:34.760
We've established the proportions and scale of our character and we've provided edge loops in places

00:34.760 --> 00:40.110
that we are going to need them like around the hips and the face.

00:40.130 --> 00:43.560
So let's go ahead and prepare for sculpting now.

00:43.820 --> 00:50.780
What I want to do is hit the tab key and go into object mode and in Object mode here I can come over

00:50.780 --> 00:56.810
to the modifiers panel and I want to apply my mirror modifier.

00:56.810 --> 01:04.130
Now I've got clipping turned on to ensure that the center line of the character is merged together.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.380
So with that I'm going to hit apply.

01:07.410 --> 01:15.710
Now one thing I want to mention here is you may have noticed that I've been saving in versions as I

01:15.710 --> 01:24.190
go through this I'm going to file save as and I'm saving these in multiple versions.

01:24.200 --> 01:31.580
That's a good idea because as you get to certain points in the process you do these kind of big things

01:31.580 --> 01:36.380
like applying the mirror modifier or changing something drastically.

01:36.830 --> 01:44.810
And those big changes can sometimes cause a problem in the computer so I always think not about if the

01:44.810 --> 01:46.090
computer crashes.

01:46.100 --> 01:47.100
What will I do.

01:47.270 --> 01:50.940
But when the computer crashes what will I do.

01:51.170 --> 01:57.040
So I always save versions of a project as I go.

01:57.050 --> 02:02.320
All right we've applied our mirror modify our So now he is all one piece.

02:02.390 --> 02:10.970
If I went in and selected say a vertex here and moved it around you can see it would not be mirrored

02:10.970 --> 02:12.280
over on the other side.

02:12.560 --> 02:17.180
So he is all one piece and is not being kept symmetrical now.

02:17.510 --> 02:23.230
So our sculp tools are down here where object mode in edit mode are right here.

02:23.420 --> 02:25.270
Here's our sculped mode.

02:25.460 --> 02:30.820
And if I click that you can see I get tools over here.

02:30.830 --> 02:35.090
Now look at what this set up here when I switched to scoped mode.

02:35.090 --> 02:38.840
That's a great reminder for me.

02:38.870 --> 02:44.220
Let me switch back to object mode and back to sculpt mode and see if it pops up again.

02:44.270 --> 02:49.490
Object has uniform scale sculpting may be unpredictable.

02:49.550 --> 02:52.780
That is a wonderful little reminder for me.

02:52.780 --> 02:55.210
Let's go take care of that.

02:55.220 --> 03:01.220
I'm going to go go back to object mode and select my character here and I'm going to press the end key

03:01.910 --> 03:06.080
and notice that the scale is nonuniform.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.940
In other words it isn't all the same it isn't all ones we really want this.

03:11.120 --> 03:20.780
And the rotation to be zeros and ones a lot of Blender's tool sets like the U-V mapping tool set and

03:20.780 --> 03:30.740
the sculpting tools that rely on global scale and rotation to do their jobs and we can make their job

03:30.770 --> 03:35.300
easier I guess if we apply the scale and rotation here.

03:35.300 --> 03:40.670
So what I'm going to do with the character in Object mode I'm going to press control a.

03:41.150 --> 03:44.480
And here we can apply transformations.

03:44.480 --> 03:49.750
So I'm going to apply the rotation and scale like that.

03:50.240 --> 03:56.900
The pivot point or object origin of the character is still here at the hips where we created that first

03:56.900 --> 03:57.610
cube.

03:57.770 --> 04:04.130
That's fine but we can also move and move that point down to the center of the grid which I think ultimately

04:04.130 --> 04:10.300
will be more useful when we rig the character and animated et cetera et cetera.

04:10.320 --> 04:15.860
So I'm going to ensure that the cursor is at the center of the grid by pressing shift s and clicking

04:15.860 --> 04:23.390
cursor to center and then I'm going to come over here to the Tools tab and click on set origin and move

04:23.390 --> 04:25.760
the origin to the 3D cursor.

04:26.900 --> 04:32.360
So now we have our scale and rotation applied.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.280
We have our pivot point down into the center of the grid.

04:36.920 --> 04:43.830
Let's try now to go back to the sculped tools and see if we get any issues.

04:43.880 --> 04:51.290
I'm going to press the End key to close that panel and I'm going to switch from object to scopes mode

04:51.920 --> 04:57.030
and we don't get a little warning up here anymore which is good.

04:57.080 --> 05:04.910
Now over on the left hand side are all the sculp tools we can click on this icon and see all the different

05:05.180 --> 05:12.910
brushes we have access to the normal one is the sculpt draw we'll be using the clay strips quite a bit

05:12.920 --> 05:19.730
here at the beginning to rough out the basic forms and we'll also be using the GRABBE as well as the

05:19.730 --> 05:25.480
smooth and the Flaten and the pinch will be using other brushes as well.

05:25.490 --> 05:31.990
But those are probably the ones we're going to use right up front now that we've turned off or applied

05:32.000 --> 05:39.460
the mirror modifier we need to ensure that our strokes at least at the beginning are going to be symmetrical.

05:39.650 --> 05:48.420
So I'm going to scroll down here and under Sematary I want to make sure that the X mirror is on.

05:48.530 --> 05:55.520
Now what I'd like to do is go ahead and begin adding resolution or subdivisions to the model so that

05:55.520 --> 05:58.670
we can begin building up our forms to do that.

05:58.670 --> 06:06.410
I'm going to come over here to the modifiers panel and click add modifier and this time instead of a

06:06.410 --> 06:17.140
mere modifier I'm going to add a multi resolution modifier and what it does is it allows us to add subdivisions

06:17.230 --> 06:24.880
by clicking the subdivide button here and then with those subdivisions added we can move up and down

06:25.300 --> 06:28.320
the subdivision layers as we sculpt.

06:28.570 --> 06:36.790
So if I click this subdivide button one time you can see it adds resolution it adds polygons to the

06:36.790 --> 06:37.720
mesh.

06:37.840 --> 06:42.700
If I hit the Z key you can kind of see them here in in the wireframe.

06:42.760 --> 06:51.490
Now if I hit it again you can see it adds even more and this is how we'll be adding resolution to our

06:51.490 --> 06:52.520
model.

06:52.600 --> 06:57.500
You can see up here that we're up to fourteen thousand faces.

06:57.730 --> 07:05.710
If I turn off the display of the modifier here you can see we go down to eight hundred or almost 900

07:05.720 --> 07:07.220
faces.

07:07.330 --> 07:11.070
So we're actually adding polygons to the model here.

07:11.080 --> 07:17.850
I'm going to click so divide one more time and now you can see it's getting smoother and the polygons

07:17.850 --> 07:19.670
are getting much smaller.

07:19.740 --> 07:25.900
So if I hit the Z key you can see that it's pretty dense.

07:25.920 --> 07:35.820
Now I can come up and down the subdivisions stack or Lares here by clicking on the arrow by the sculped.

07:36.150 --> 07:41.200
So this is what we'll see in the sculped window here.

07:41.380 --> 07:47.350
And this is what we'll see in the actual render if we rendered out the model that I'm going to move

07:47.350 --> 07:48.780
this back up to three here.

07:48.790 --> 07:55.180
Now I can't go any higher until I click on the subdivide button again to create a new subdivision level

07:56.080 --> 07:57.130
to sculpt on this.

07:57.130 --> 08:02.360
I'm going to be using a way come into this pen and tablet.

08:02.800 --> 08:12.010
You don't need to spend a lot on a tablet but it is a necessity when sculpting like this doing this

08:12.010 --> 08:16.030
kind of work with a mouse is next to impossible.

08:16.030 --> 08:23.530
I think you really do need something that you can draw with and has pressure sensitivity to it.

08:23.950 --> 08:30.940
So I'm going to get out my pen here and I'm going to go to the clay strips brush first.

08:30.970 --> 08:37.450
And the reason why I'm going to do this is I want to keep it very rough and not get into too much detail

08:37.450 --> 08:43.140
at the beginning and I want to work on this chest area.

08:43.210 --> 08:49.750
Now we can begin testing this and see how this works so you can see as I stroke on the character we

08:49.750 --> 08:54.800
can lay down these kind of rough strips of clay.

08:54.990 --> 09:00.290
I think I'd like the strength of mind to be a little bit more a little bit stronger.

09:00.330 --> 09:08.880
You've got strength and radius over here and with these Sliders but you've also got the keyboard shortcut

09:08.880 --> 09:18.650
keys of F which allows you to increase or decrease the size of your brush and also shift f allows you

09:18.650 --> 09:22.570
to increase or decrease the strength of your brush.

09:22.620 --> 09:32.600
So I'll put my strength right around here and click and I'll begin laying down some clay strips here.

09:32.600 --> 09:38.060
So what I want to do is just kind of block out the rib cage of the character

09:41.470 --> 09:45.530
think I'll go over to the character images view here.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.230
I'll just begin blocking this out.

09:49.170 --> 09:58.320
Now I can hide the arms here so they don't get in the way I want to just tumble around and I'm going

09:58.320 --> 10:06.060
to press the H key on the keyboard and click and drag and hide the arm and then I'm going to press the

10:06.060 --> 10:12.990
three key to come back to the side view here and I'll just begin blocking out where I think the rib

10:12.990 --> 10:14.120
cage would be.

10:14.130 --> 10:18.010
And I think it would probably be right around in here.

10:19.090 --> 10:31.730
This spin around to the back side with control one on the front view here spin around to the back and

10:31.730 --> 10:33.910
lay some down here as well.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.940
Let's go back to the front view here.

10:40.060 --> 10:44.430
And just build that out a little more so that's probably good enough for now.

10:44.430 --> 10:49.490
Now this is all going to be very rough so bear with me here.

10:49.620 --> 10:54.210
I'm going to press the shift key and smooth this back a little bit.

10:54.210 --> 10:57.180
You can always press shift and smooth.

10:57.180 --> 10:59.400
Anything you do.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.720
The next thing I'm going to do is just block out the torso as well.

11:03.790 --> 11:07.370
I'll go back to my default view.

11:07.370 --> 11:09.960
Press Allt aches to bring the arm back.

11:10.610 --> 11:19.330
And let's just block out the torso or the hips I mean and for this is just going to be a block

11:25.240 --> 11:26.460
something like this

11:31.260 --> 11:33.760
not going to work on the legs a bit.

11:33.760 --> 11:38.920
What I want to do is create that teardrop shape for the thighs.

11:39.970 --> 11:43.360
And I'll just begin sculpting this area in here.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.430
Right in here.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.370
So I'm going to try and build this up

11:51.990 --> 11:53.220
for the thighs.

11:59.980 --> 12:05.120
I want to block out the box of the knees.

12:05.190 --> 12:16.830
So just maybe a box like this for the needs and I want to build up kind of an oval shape for the calves

12:16.830 --> 12:18.810
as well back here.

12:18.930 --> 12:25.030
So I'll come back here and begin somewhere around in here.

12:25.260 --> 12:29.160
Building up an oval shaped for the Cavs.

12:37.960 --> 12:38.960
There we go.

12:40.230 --> 12:47.010
And I'll also do a little bit of work to build up the hamstrings as well.

12:47.010 --> 12:56.010
So as you can see I'm just building up the major forms of of the character and I'm doing it in a very

12:56.400 --> 13:01.700
rough kind of way at this point in time just worrying about the forms.

13:01.710 --> 13:09.420
Not so much about the details we'll get to the details one of the biggest temptations is to begin working

13:09.450 --> 13:11.600
on the details right up front.

13:11.940 --> 13:21.060
And I would really suggest that you try and build up the rough forms first and then only after they're

13:21.060 --> 13:25.100
all in place begin dealing with the details.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.590
Also when it come over here and work on

13:30.180 --> 13:36.320
but a bit just going to build this up a little bit more.

13:36.660 --> 13:43.980
Now you can also cut in to speak in reverse or invert a tool by pressing the control key.

13:43.980 --> 13:51.250
So instead of sculpting out or pulling out I can cut in to an area by holding the control key down.

13:51.950 --> 13:59.630
So I want to build this up and kind of separate it from the hamstrings.

13:59.850 --> 14:00.380
All right.

14:00.390 --> 14:07.730
Well we're beginning to make some progress here we're blocking in the major forms of the character.

14:07.770 --> 14:14.700
I know it doesn't look like much right now but this is really an important part of the process is to

14:14.700 --> 14:21.010
build up the fundamental forms first before we jump into the details.
