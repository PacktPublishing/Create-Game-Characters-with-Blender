00:00.660 --> 00:07.190
Let's continue our texture painting and as I've said before I kind of like to try and find that the

00:07.220 --> 00:09.260
easiest thing to do first.

00:09.260 --> 00:16.400
It kind of eases me into the process whatever it is working on currently and I'm not sure exactly what

00:16.400 --> 00:17.900
would be the easiest for me.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.300
Maybe this belt.

00:20.300 --> 00:27.900
I was thinking maybe I should do the belt and straps first and that would kind of ease me into the process.

00:27.920 --> 00:32.330
So what I really need to do is find reference images.

00:32.330 --> 00:36.830
So I'm going to go out to Google and just see what I can find.

00:36.950 --> 00:45.620
So I'm just going to look for leather belt on Google and go to images and they look a little too new

00:45.620 --> 00:46.420
to me.

00:47.370 --> 00:56.720
Let's about something like worn leather belt that's getting there something like this.

00:58.210 --> 01:02.530
And old old worn leather belt.

01:03.040 --> 01:11.440
I'm also going to come over here to the search tools go to size and look for anything large like that

01:11.530 --> 01:16.090
just so I have a nice big image to work with.

01:16.220 --> 01:20.050
I kind of like the leather of this chair.

01:20.050 --> 01:24.910
I guess that's for shotgun shells or something I kind of like that.

01:24.910 --> 01:29.070
I may grab that kind of like this one too.

01:29.510 --> 01:36.980
So I think I'll grab a couple out of here that I can use in Blender to be a reference image as well

01:36.980 --> 01:39.480
as to sample colors off of.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.770
All right back in Blender.

01:40.770 --> 01:46.760
Let's go ahead and create a new window here I'm going to click on this tab and drag down to create a

01:46.760 --> 01:48.030
new window.

01:48.500 --> 01:56.150
And in this window what I'd like to do is open up a new image and I'll go find those reference images

01:56.990 --> 02:02.270
and I'll click on this button up here to display thumbnails of all the images.

02:02.270 --> 02:04.100
And here we go.

02:04.100 --> 02:10.300
So I've got a couple of images kind of like this one for different colors.

02:10.310 --> 02:15.390
I'll begin with this one I think and I'll open the image and there it is.

02:15.770 --> 02:24.470
So also what I need to do is come over here and make sure that this mode is set to paint and I don't

02:24.470 --> 02:34.200
really need the U-V wires over this so I'll go to View and turn off draw texture paint UVA's and there

02:34.200 --> 02:35.520
we go.

02:36.300 --> 02:44.250
So this has some nice imagery here with the different colors and even the texture I kind of like I don't

02:44.250 --> 02:49.460
know that I'll try and replicate the texture exactly but I do like what's going on here.

02:49.470 --> 02:49.860
All right.

02:49.860 --> 02:53.800
So having said that let's zoom in to our belt here.

02:54.150 --> 03:00.420
Once we get here I'm going to press alt F to frame up the area underneath the cursor and now it will

03:01.080 --> 03:03.460
tumble around at that point.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.460
I'm going to zoom in to where it is on the UVM map.

03:07.530 --> 03:08.630
Here it is.

03:09.060 --> 03:16.320
So to begin I'm going to create a new texture paint slot that's transparent that when I paint on it

03:16.620 --> 03:19.570
we'll be able to see over the base color.

03:19.740 --> 03:28.650
So I'll come up here to add texture paint slot create a diffuse color slot I'll call this.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.270
Oh I don't know let's just call this details one.

03:32.970 --> 03:34.200
Let's do that.

03:34.680 --> 03:40.480
Let's make these 2048.

03:40.690 --> 03:42.640
And now here's the important part of this.

03:42.640 --> 03:50.530
We need to take the color from this black and we need to change this from an alpha of one to an alpha

03:50.530 --> 03:51.720
of zero.

03:51.970 --> 03:57.820
So that this slot is completely transparent and we can see through it to the base color.

03:57.940 --> 04:02.020
So now that I've got that Alpha to zero Our click OK.

04:02.410 --> 04:06.700
And there we go we've got our details map here.

04:06.890 --> 04:07.870
Right here it is.

04:07.870 --> 04:10.130
It's transparent.

04:10.390 --> 04:15.370
But when we use it to paint with we'll be able to see it over our base color.

04:15.370 --> 04:20.320
Let me switch back to the belt image here.

04:20.590 --> 04:26.690
So now if I come in here and hover over this image I'll hold down the Esc key.

04:26.830 --> 04:29.550
I can then click and sample a color.

04:29.590 --> 04:37.900
Let me go back to the Tools tab and I'll switch from the Phil brush to the texture draw so I can hover

04:37.900 --> 04:38.820
over here.

04:39.990 --> 04:48.020
And find a color maybe something like this.

04:48.190 --> 04:58.360
And now I have that color sampled here I'll reduce the strength and if I zoom in here you can see that

04:58.390 --> 05:03.740
I can begin just laying down bits of color there.

05:03.790 --> 05:07.180
Now it's a little blotchy.

05:07.180 --> 05:12.730
There are some things I can do to add a bit of interest to the paint stroke here.

05:12.790 --> 05:15.600
I'll scroll down in the Tools tab.

05:17.850 --> 05:28.590
Down here to stroke and within here we've got the jitter and spacing fields the jitter just sprays the

05:28.590 --> 05:30.620
paint out in blotches.

05:30.630 --> 05:38.400
So I'm gonna increase that just a bit and the spacing dictates how far those blotches will be will be

05:38.400 --> 05:39.350
dispersed.

05:39.390 --> 05:45.540
So if I come in here and I draw here let me get the spacing out a little bit more and the jitter out

05:45.540 --> 05:47.480
a little bit more.

05:47.650 --> 05:52.860
You can see it's beginning to lay down these kind of blotches as I paint.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.690
Now that's not quite what I wanted.

05:54.690 --> 06:00.550
But we're getting there so I want to reduce that a bit reduce the jitter a bit.

06:01.620 --> 06:06.900
And just come in here and lightly paint along the edges and you can see now I'm getting a little bit

06:06.900 --> 06:13.740
more randomness to the stroke and that's kind of what I want I mean and do this and I'm going to take

06:13.740 --> 06:19.200
this strength down just a little bit more.

06:19.280 --> 06:25.720
Now just going to paint around the edges here as if it's been worn around the edges.

06:25.890 --> 06:26.460
You know we go

06:37.690 --> 06:43.330
now you should be able to see the strokes laying down here in the U-V editor and sure enough here they

06:43.330 --> 06:44.600
are.

06:44.600 --> 06:55.000
Now if my mowed down here is set to paint and it is I can use the paint tools over here in the U-V editor

06:55.000 --> 06:55.890
as well.

06:56.750 --> 07:02.330
So if I came in here and reduce the size of the brush I'm going to hit the F key and reduce the size

07:02.330 --> 07:08.210
of the brush so I could actually do my painting here if I wanted as well.

07:08.210 --> 07:16.840
Just like this you can see that that extends the paint on over here.

07:18.490 --> 07:24.750
So it's really kind of how you want to do the work kind of helps to have both.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.240
So you can see what you're doing.

07:27.250 --> 07:37.150
So in addition to having your texture slot come in or be a blend type of mix you can also change your

07:37.150 --> 07:45.550
blend types here so maybe what you've painted now you'd like to have be blended with the multiply mode

07:45.550 --> 07:47.560
and you can see how that darkens that up.

07:47.560 --> 07:58.600
Now you could change to screen or Litan so you can have different mix modes here.

07:58.600 --> 08:04.730
Now as I mentioned before this image is a completely separate image now.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.750
It's not it's not by default.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.520
Part of the scene file.

08:09.700 --> 08:14.400
So each texture slot is its own image file on your hard drive.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.490
And notice here we have the Asterix again.

08:17.620 --> 08:23.780
So I'm going to click on the image menu and I'm going to save this as its own image.

08:23.800 --> 08:31.690
I want to click save as image and here's where I'm keeping my texture paint layers and this one details

08:31.690 --> 08:35.570
one that sounds pretty good so I'll just click save as image.

08:35.590 --> 08:39.610
Now that's been saved as an image on its own.

08:39.790 --> 08:47.250
If we want to then save it again if I do a little more painting here let's say I come around here and

08:47.250 --> 08:48.990
do a little more painting.

08:48.990 --> 08:50.770
Now the Asterix is back.

08:50.910 --> 08:55.010
I can always come in and click alt s here.

08:55.330 --> 08:56.030
Yes.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.400
To save the image.

08:57.420 --> 09:05.130
Here it says saved image up here but once again I also need to press control or command s to save the

09:05.130 --> 09:06.850
scene as well.

09:06.920 --> 09:15.290
Now in the end you can always pack your scene and your images together over here under external data.

09:15.300 --> 09:22.830
You can pack all into a single blend file but that really doesn't help you as you're working as you're

09:22.830 --> 09:27.410
saving the scene and the image again and again.

09:27.480 --> 09:34.530
All right so I'm going to work a little bit more on the straps and the belt and in the next video we'll

09:34.530 --> 09:36.620
continue on with our texture painting.
