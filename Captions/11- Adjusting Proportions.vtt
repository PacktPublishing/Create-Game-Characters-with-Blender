00:00.820 --> 00:07.660
Today I think I'd like to work a little bit on proportions here now that I've got some of the basic

00:07.660 --> 00:15.430
forms of the character roughed in I can begin to look at the proportions of the character as a whole.

00:15.700 --> 00:22.610
And I think it looks to me like the torso is a little too long and the legs are a little too short.

00:22.900 --> 00:31.330
And also as I continued down here on the hips and the legs I think I'm going to want these legs to be

00:31.840 --> 00:34.530
spread apart just a little bit more.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.370
So let's work on those things right now for the torso.

00:39.700 --> 00:47.140
I think what I should do is come back to my character images screen layout and it looks to me like I

00:47.140 --> 00:52.530
could bring this up just a bit if I hit the Z key.

00:52.540 --> 00:55.940
I get this very dense mesh.

00:55.960 --> 01:04.630
But if I hit this optimal display checkbox over here in the multi resolution modifier I get the original

01:04.750 --> 01:07.730
edge lines of the mesh here.

01:07.810 --> 01:16.440
So what I like to do is just go to Edit mode and just grab the vertices of the hips.

01:16.750 --> 01:23.590
So I'll just press B for border select and drag select these and then just move them up some maybe up

01:23.590 --> 01:26.530
to that belt area.

01:26.530 --> 01:32.650
Now if I hit tab and go back to object mode I'll also go back to sculpt mode and take a look at that.

01:34.270 --> 01:41.090
Right so that's pulled that area up a little bit more it's collapse the bottom of that abdomen area

01:41.180 --> 01:42.800
a bit.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.040
I think that might do it.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.090
Let's take a look.

01:46.450 --> 01:53.270
Yeah that gives us a little bit more length in the legs and not as much in the torso.

01:55.290 --> 01:57.150
Yeah I think I like that.

01:57.750 --> 02:01.810
Let's take a look at spreading the legs out here.

02:02.010 --> 02:09.720
When you go back to that character images view and let me just go to this front view.

02:09.720 --> 02:17.670
I can press control up arrow and that will make that one view that my cursor was hovering over full

02:17.670 --> 02:25.740
screen so I'll tab into edit mode and what I'll do is I'll just select this edge right here and I'm

02:25.740 --> 02:29.640
going to tumble around an alt shift select that.

02:29.640 --> 02:36.690
So now I've got that ring around the top of the leg there and I'll press shift s and I'm going to move

02:36.690 --> 02:41.690
the cursor to those selected objects right there.

02:41.720 --> 02:49.530
Now the one key to go back to the front view and that what I'd like to do is select all of these and

02:49.560 --> 02:50.940
rotate the leg.

02:50.940 --> 02:53.540
At this point out just a bit.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.610
So it's kind of like this leg here.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.440
So they're spread out just a bit.

02:59.730 --> 03:05.470
I'm going to hit Control up arrow again so that I can look at my tools panel.

03:05.520 --> 03:11.390
I'll hit the T key and over here while I'm in edit mode I've got this Options tab.

03:11.730 --> 03:20.070
And I want to turn on X mirror and that will allow me to change this one leg in the other leg will stay

03:20.070 --> 03:21.600
symmetrical.

03:21.600 --> 03:27.600
All right so I've got that I'll go back to my full screen view with control up arrow.

03:28.650 --> 03:36.720
And here I'll go to face mode and select this row of faces down here with Allt select an edge right

03:36.720 --> 03:42.790
between faces and control plus to expand my selection.

03:42.840 --> 03:49.800
Up to that point where the cursor is now I want to move this pivot point after that cursor so I'll change

03:49.800 --> 03:53.360
my pivot point from median to 3D cursor.

03:54.340 --> 03:59.920
And now when I move or rotate or scale it will happen from that point.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.310
So now I need to rotate.

04:02.310 --> 04:09.450
I'm going to I could come over here and click this and drag this but I'm actually going to press the

04:09.540 --> 04:17.850
R key for rotate and then press the Y key to rotate just around the y axis and then I'm going to pull

04:17.850 --> 04:20.440
these out just a bit like that.

04:20.610 --> 04:23.360
They're all right.

04:23.440 --> 04:28.720
So now we've got that now I need to do the same thing for the feet and bend them back so they're flat

04:28.720 --> 04:30.270
on the ground.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.170
So let's come in here.

04:32.220 --> 04:39.760
I mean we hit a de-select Z for wireframe and I'm going to hit the B key for border select and drag

04:39.760 --> 04:41.830
select the foot area.

04:41.830 --> 04:48.420
This is what I need to rotate but the cursor or the center of rotation is still up here.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.300
I need to change that now don't I.

04:50.310 --> 05:01.480
So I'll hit the alt key and tumble around and all shift to select this ring around the ankle and then

05:01.480 --> 05:05.800
I'll press shift as cursor to selected.

05:05.880 --> 05:19.850
And now if I go to face mode select these control plus and then control minus to get back down to there.

05:20.100 --> 05:31.020
Now I should be able to hit bar and Y and rotate these back and maybe even move them down so maybe I'll

05:31.020 --> 05:41.810
hit G and Z and pull these down just a hair like that all right did we actually do it.

05:42.130 --> 05:43.400
Let's see.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.670
I'll hit tab.

05:44.860 --> 05:55.130
And there's our sculpted version all heat control up arrow and then I'll come back to my default view.

05:55.150 --> 06:06.070
So there we have our character with the torso not quite so long and the feet and legs spread apart just

06:06.160 --> 06:07.000
a little bit.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.500
I think that looks a little bit better.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.430
Now the other bit of proportion work I might do is with the neck.

06:13.450 --> 06:21.280
I feel like the neck and shoulder area the the traps up here seem a little bit too beefy for

06:24.230 --> 06:25.340
the actual image.

06:25.340 --> 06:26.570
Let me take a look here.

06:26.570 --> 06:30.140
I'm just going to select another layer so I can see.

06:30.230 --> 06:33.890
Yes see I've got his neck pretty small here.

06:33.890 --> 06:38.570
He's still got a bit of traps here but not quite that beefy.

06:38.570 --> 06:41.320
So I need to work on that a bit.

06:42.650 --> 06:51.690
Let's bring him back and let's take a look at this part and see if I can maybe do it like I did before

06:52.470 --> 06:56.030
with just the bass Masch.

06:56.150 --> 07:03.350
It's possible because if we look at it here you can see that the base match isn't quite right either.

07:03.740 --> 07:10.630
So I'm going to hit the Tiki and turn off x mirror and I'll go to edge mode here.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.440
And I want to select this edge right here.

07:14.690 --> 07:22.630
I'd like to change the pivot point back to median and let's scale this in and see what happens.

07:26.130 --> 07:36.770
So I will just hit the s key and scale this in a bit like so so and maybe scale this one in as well.

07:39.680 --> 07:46.890
Let's also try and just move this one down a hair like this and let's see what happens when we do this

07:50.680 --> 07:52.620
and try this.

07:52.670 --> 07:58.790
All right so now let's go back to our sculped mode and let's see if anything changed.

07:58.790 --> 08:02.680
Not really a little bit but not a lot.

08:02.780 --> 08:08.870
What I'm going to do is hit the T key and come back over here to the Tools panel and go to the grab

08:08.870 --> 08:10.590
brush.

08:10.730 --> 08:14.290
I'm just going to gently try and bring these down a bit.

08:23.620 --> 08:24.510
Something like that.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.590
Let's see how that looks.

08:26.590 --> 08:31.440
I'll go back and minimize this screen with control up arrow again.

08:31.540 --> 08:35.880
Go back to my default view and let's take a look at this.

08:36.820 --> 08:43.330
So yeah I think that helped with the neck there I think I like that a little bit better.

08:43.330 --> 08:50.290
He doesn't look quite as beefy but also he's got a little bit more of a heroic stance with the shorter

08:50.290 --> 08:53.200
torso and longer legs.

08:53.200 --> 08:59.610
I think one last bit of adjustments on proportion here is the width of the chest.

08:59.620 --> 09:04.810
I think I'd like to try and pull this out just a little bit and see what happens.

09:04.840 --> 09:10.390
I don't know if it's going to work or if it's going to help but I'd like to try it and see just the

09:10.390 --> 09:14.670
width here so I'm going to bring this out a bit.

09:14.710 --> 09:21.780
I just want to gently bring this part out like this.

09:22.960 --> 09:32.160
Very gently and maybe even pull some of these in a hair.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.010
All right we'll see how that works.

09:35.140 --> 09:38.530
These kinds of adjustments can be made throughout the process.

09:38.530 --> 09:44.260
But I thought this was a good time now to take a look at the character as a whole now that some of the

09:44.350 --> 09:46.820
muscles have been roughed in.

09:46.840 --> 09:54.190
Also I want to make another pitch for using good reference images get a lot of them from a lot of different

09:54.190 --> 09:59.690
angles even if you're creating some sort of fantasy character like this.

09:59.770 --> 10:04.450
It really helps to ground your work in reality when you use reference images.
