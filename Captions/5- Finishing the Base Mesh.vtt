00:00.730 --> 00:06.370
Well we've got our character pretty much blocked in but the last few things we need to do is work on

00:06.370 --> 00:13.690
the head and the face and also begin pulling some points to round the character out so he isn't quite

00:13.690 --> 00:15.340
so blocky.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.200
So let's work on that.

00:17.350 --> 00:22.990
First let's deal with well let's work on the ears.

00:23.070 --> 00:26.560
Let's take a look at the front and side views again.

00:26.850 --> 00:30.040
And let's take a look at the ears here.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.880
I think that for the ears we could select maybe these four faces on the side of the head and we could

00:40.880 --> 00:47.840
use these to extrude the ears out so I'll press e for extrude and then click and I'm going to go straight

00:47.840 --> 00:50.690
to the scale tool and scale in.

00:50.690 --> 00:58.570
I'm going to hit the ESC key and scale in a bit and I might go back over to my default view to see how

00:58.570 --> 01:00.160
this is working.

01:00.460 --> 01:06.610
I mean the period key on the number pad and it's looking a little pushed in I'm going to go ahead and

01:06.940 --> 01:15.170
bring it out a bit let's bring it out like that and I'll scale this in.

01:16.090 --> 01:16.390
All right.

01:16.390 --> 01:18.340
So let's go and extrude out again.

01:18.350 --> 01:20.830
I'm going to hit E and extrude.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.410
I'll pull it out a bit.

01:25.070 --> 01:29.620
Scale it in a tad move it back a bit.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.440
We we'll just see if we can't block these out.

01:33.440 --> 01:39.020
Now remember that these need to be a little bit smaller than the actual ear just like I've tried to

01:39.020 --> 01:46.100
stay smaller than the head and the smaller than the body here we need room to sculpt out when I go back

01:46.100 --> 01:49.660
to my default view and see how we're doing here.

01:49.670 --> 01:53.720
It's pretty ugly so I'm going to have to begin pulling some points now here.

01:53.720 --> 01:59.690
So I'm just going to begin arranging the points to try and create a better shape for the ear.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.160
All right.

02:19.160 --> 02:23.870
I've done a little point pulling to get the ear shaped up a bit.

02:23.900 --> 02:33.380
I've just tried to get more of a flat rectangular shape here from the ear so I think what I'll do now

02:33.380 --> 02:42.790
is select these faces and let's start extruding again I'll go back to the character images view and

02:42.800 --> 02:51.500
now press me and then click and then pull back out with the G key scale these in a bit with the Eski

02:52.460 --> 02:56.340
so I can begin to kind of shape it up like this.

02:56.450 --> 02:58.000
I'd like to move it back a bit.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.120
I think it moves.

02:59.120 --> 03:08.360
It should kind of go back as it comes out and from here I'll go ahead and extrude one more time.

03:08.600 --> 03:14.300
Pressing the G key and pulling out scaling and.

03:14.420 --> 03:20.120
And I think I'll do it one more time beyond that as well to get out to the tip of the ear.

03:21.650 --> 03:24.260
E quick G and move out.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.780
And I'll go ahead and scale this out.

03:27.560 --> 03:28.680
Just a bit

03:31.520 --> 03:34.400
so let's take a look at it in the default view.

03:35.310 --> 03:37.780
That's a little long.

03:39.390 --> 03:42.380
Let's move that back a bit.

03:42.410 --> 03:45.150
We do that is quite an ear there.

03:45.150 --> 03:53.190
Let's move these back I'm going to go to Virtex mode and hit the Z key and I want to just grab these

03:53.190 --> 04:02.020
edges here so you can hold down the control key and click and drag and lasso select points like that.

04:02.520 --> 04:06.040
So I'm going to grab that and move them back a bit.

04:06.270 --> 04:07.340
There we go.

04:07.740 --> 04:08.630
All right.

04:08.940 --> 04:12.890
I think that will work for the ears.

04:13.850 --> 04:20.480
Let's take a look at the face now I went ahead and did the ears before the face because we're going

04:20.480 --> 04:22.580
to add more geometry to this.

04:22.580 --> 04:27.830
Now we're going to add more edges and I wanted to do the extruding and point pulling when there were

04:27.830 --> 04:29.830
fewer points to pull.

04:29.840 --> 04:36.280
So now for the eyes I think what I want is an edge right through here.

04:36.440 --> 04:45.760
So our press control our and click and drag and edge right through here and for the mouth for the mouth.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.220
I think I'll do.

04:48.360 --> 04:53.180
It's going to be tight but I think I'll try three edges in here I'm going to press control our and I'm

04:53.180 --> 04:59.810
going to scroll the mouse wheel and let's try for three edges here let's see what happens.

05:01.570 --> 05:08.440
All right for the eyes I'm going to select these faces.

05:09.860 --> 05:13.500
And I'll hit the click.

05:13.500 --> 05:19.690
Hit the key and scale those in oh let me scale this out one more time.

05:20.030 --> 05:26.930
Bring it out and I'll hit the scale and one more time.

05:26.930 --> 05:34.910
So that's just giving us geometry to work with down here in the face.

05:34.910 --> 05:37.460
We could take this area for the mouth.

05:37.460 --> 05:44.240
Hit the scale in it easy the scale in.

05:44.240 --> 05:44.540
All right.

05:44.540 --> 05:50.650
So that gives us edge loops around the mouth and the eyes that I think we can work with.

05:50.960 --> 05:55.070
Let's look at the nose should we do something with the nose here.

05:55.160 --> 05:59.840
We could give ourselves a little extra geometry for the nose as well I imagine.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.580
Let's do that.

06:00.590 --> 06:09.170
I'll select this it be I'm going to kind of pull out just a hair once again I know it doesn't look like

06:09.170 --> 06:18.990
much but that's not the point here the point here is to get us geometry that we can work with.

06:19.210 --> 06:22.870
That should help out quite a bit actually.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.840
And we go.

06:27.850 --> 06:28.210
All right.

06:28.210 --> 06:31.010
So there is the face in the ears.

06:31.240 --> 06:35.170
Let's also work just a little bit on rounding the body out.

06:35.170 --> 06:37.710
I think all the geometry is here now.

06:38.230 --> 06:41.020
Let's work on just a rounding out the body.

06:41.020 --> 06:47.800
Now I'm going to just go into vertex mode and just begin pulling points and just begin rounding the

06:47.800 --> 06:49.690
character out like this.

06:49.690 --> 07:09.640
So it isn't quite so blocky.

07:09.700 --> 07:16.020
So I've been pulling points here just trying to round out the body and the legs.

07:16.090 --> 07:20.460
And I also wanted to point out a tool that you can use for something like this.

07:20.550 --> 07:25.150
It isn't perfect but it can help sometimes like for the arms and the legs.

07:25.210 --> 07:31.660
What I have down here under the Tools tab is a section called Loop tools.

07:31.660 --> 07:36.210
And if I scroll this down you can see I've got some tools here.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.530
This circle tool can help us out.

07:39.550 --> 07:49.120
Now the way to add this plug in or add on is to go to file and user preferences and then you can go

07:49.120 --> 07:50.870
to Add ons.

07:51.110 --> 07:54.750
And notice here I've got me go scroll down.

07:54.830 --> 07:56.170
Here we go.

07:56.330 --> 08:04.550
I've got this mesh loop tools checked and this is what gives you that section over here.

08:04.550 --> 08:12.050
Now if you can't find it you can always just come up here to the search field and type in loop and it

08:12.050 --> 08:13.940
will go to that selection.

08:13.940 --> 08:22.100
Now just add a checkmark here and then click save user settings and then you should see this area or

08:22.100 --> 08:25.330
this section here in the Tools tab.

08:25.340 --> 08:35.270
Now what it can do for you is Ahman Allt select this row of edges or points here and then if I just

08:35.270 --> 08:40.600
click circle it it'll round those out into a circle.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.640
Now as I said it isn't perfect.

08:42.650 --> 08:49.790
It may not do exactly what you want it to do and then you can just undo but it can help when doing something

08:49.790 --> 08:50.700
like this.

08:50.720 --> 08:58.310
And I'm just going to use the circle to create circles for the arms and I'll come down here for the

08:58.400 --> 08:59.690
legs as well.

09:01.040 --> 09:08.390
And you see how it kind of ballooned it out so it doesn't always work perfectly but you can test it

09:08.480 --> 09:09.930
and see what you think.

09:11.480 --> 09:15.140
All right well I think we're just about ready to sculpt.

09:15.140 --> 09:20.280
We've got our base geometry done and it's looking pretty good.

09:20.300 --> 09:25.070
Now once again we did all this work up front before we began sculpting.

09:25.070 --> 09:32.330
So we would have the proper geometry and the proper edge flow so that we're not fighting against the

09:32.330 --> 09:34.720
mesh as we begin sculpting.
