WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:05.480
Well we're finally to the point where we can begin working on read typology.

00:05.640 --> 00:10.930
Now right now this character is almost eight million tries.

00:11.190 --> 00:13.620
So it's pretty dense.

00:13.620 --> 00:19.740
This isn't something that we could take into a video game not even on the best console's at this point

00:19.740 --> 00:20.830
in time.

00:20.850 --> 00:30.180
So what we've got to do is read to apologize or recreate the character in a much lower polygon form.

00:30.300 --> 00:37.450
So if we can get this character down to 10 20 30 thousand tries I think we'll be doing good.

00:37.470 --> 00:43.020
Now there's a lot of different ways that you can make a video game character you could begin right off

00:43.020 --> 00:51.390
with low poly version and then texture that what sculpting I think allows you to do is to have a little

00:51.390 --> 00:55.860
more freedom an artistic license as you're creating.

00:55.860 --> 00:58.410
To me it's a little more free flowing.

00:58.590 --> 01:04.490
But in exchange for that kind of freedom you've got to spend the time to go back and read to apologize.

01:04.770 --> 01:11.190
So we're going to create a low poly version of this character and then ultimately what we will do is

01:11.250 --> 01:20.130
bake a normal map that will take all of this high resolution detail and bake it into a texture map that

01:20.130 --> 01:24.340
we can then apply to the low poly version in the game.

01:24.390 --> 01:27.000
So let's get started on that.

01:27.090 --> 01:31.790
The first thing I'd do is just hide all the clothes and accessories.

01:31.890 --> 01:38.360
I've got all of them on Layer 2 here and I've got the character on Layer 1.

01:38.460 --> 01:44.370
The next thing I want to do is actually create an object that is going to be the read to apologized

01:44.460 --> 01:45.540
mesh.

01:45.540 --> 01:51.670
So to do that I'm gonna come over here to create tab click on cube and there is our cube.

01:52.050 --> 01:56.050
Call this real Toppo just so we know what it is.

01:56.070 --> 02:05.430
As we're working on it and then I'll tab into edit mode in vertex mode.

02:05.440 --> 02:12.640
I'll select all the vertices and then I'll just hit X and delete vertices.

02:12.670 --> 02:18.700
So now we have an object that has no services has no geometry.

02:18.690 --> 02:21.220
All right so let's zoom into the character here.

02:21.220 --> 02:29.110
I'm going to press Shift B and drag an area to zoom into and there he is.

02:29.110 --> 02:35.740
I'll hit the one key on the keyboard to go to the front view and our perspective view here is a little

02:35.740 --> 02:36.550
bit distorted.

02:36.550 --> 02:39.340
I don't like how it's kind of a wide angle lens.

02:39.340 --> 02:45.430
I think that's going to be difficult to deal with if I hit the five key to go to orthographic view.

02:45.520 --> 02:50.040
It looks like that and it looks crazy it looks a little scary.

02:50.090 --> 02:53.280
I'm gonna hit the five key again to get out of that.

02:53.530 --> 02:55.970
Well that's something you just can't unsee.

02:55.990 --> 03:05.200
So I'm going to hit the N key and here I want to scroll up and for the viewport Lim's angle I think

03:05.200 --> 03:08.680
I'm just going to type in 75 and hit enter.

03:08.680 --> 03:13.030
And that gives me a little bit more flattened view of the character.

03:13.030 --> 03:14.890
I think that'll work out OK.

03:16.540 --> 03:23.920
If you've seen my previous character creation series on YouTube you know that in that series I kind

03:23.920 --> 03:30.400
of created or drew out the edge loops of the face in two dimensions.

03:30.640 --> 03:38.020
And the reason why I did the edge loops the way I did is because you really want the edges of the character's

03:38.020 --> 03:43.380
face to mirror the muscle structure of the human face.

03:43.810 --> 03:50.110
And if you look at the muscles of the human face you'll see that there are these kind of loops around

03:50.110 --> 03:58.060
the eyes and the mouth and those specific structures are what allow our faces to move in the way they

03:58.060 --> 03:58.620
do.

03:58.810 --> 04:05.890
So what we'll try and do is we'll try and replicate this structure the loops around the eyes and the

04:05.890 --> 04:06.550
mouth.

04:06.670 --> 04:14.290
And one of the ways to do that is to structure your edge loops like this around the mouth the nose the

04:14.290 --> 04:16.130
eyes etc..

04:16.240 --> 04:21.510
So what we're going to be doing is using this particular image as a guide.

04:21.940 --> 04:28.130
I found this out on the internet years ago and I wish I knew who created it.

04:28.130 --> 04:33.460
If you if you know please let me know because I'd love to give them credit.

04:33.460 --> 04:39.220
I've been using this particular image in the classroom and the classes that I teach for years so I'd

04:39.220 --> 04:40.780
love to know who created this.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.440
It's been a really good educational tool.

04:43.630 --> 04:47.170
So I'll put a link to this image in the description of the video.

04:47.380 --> 04:52.000
I'm going to go ahead and create a new screen over here.

04:52.000 --> 05:00.300
Just grab this and pull it down and I'll switch to the U-V editor and I'll bring that image in.

05:01.350 --> 05:08.040
All right I think I'll turn off the mat cap here so just scroll down and turn that off.

05:08.070 --> 05:13.740
So we still have this read Toppo object in edit mode.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.830
That's good we need that.

05:16.350 --> 05:21.990
So let's scroll back up here in the properties panel to the grease pencil area.

05:22.170 --> 05:27.410
Let's click on new to create a new grease pencil data block.

05:27.750 --> 05:32.220
We want to have object and surface selected.

05:32.220 --> 05:36.300
We also want to have continuous drawing selected.

05:36.330 --> 05:44.000
So now if I hit draw that will create a new grease pencil layer and activate the grease pencil here

05:44.000 --> 05:45.760
in the 3-D view.

05:45.800 --> 05:53.240
So I'm going to zoom in a bit and what I'm going to do is I'm going to begin by drawing out this loop

05:53.330 --> 05:56.870
of edges right around the lips.

05:57.070 --> 06:01.750
So I'll begin here in the middle and I'll just click and draw straight down.

06:02.430 --> 06:13.400
And draw one coming down out of the middle of the nostril one from the edge of the nose one right about

06:13.400 --> 06:14.450
here.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.450
I'll do two around the mouth like this.

06:22.060 --> 06:27.220
One kind of from the chin toward the lip here and one right here in the center.

06:28.200 --> 06:28.810
OK.

06:28.910 --> 06:33.830
So if I tumble around you can see that those have been constrained to the object.

06:33.830 --> 06:41.700
That's because we have this object and surface selected so I'll hit enter to confirm that.

06:41.700 --> 06:49.320
Now what I can do is come over the Tools panel and I've got this beast services plug in here in my tools

06:49.320 --> 06:50.160
panel.

06:50.160 --> 06:55.950
Now this plug in is enabled through the user preferences window.

06:55.950 --> 07:04.170
So I'm going to go to a file user preferences and if I go to Add ons and just type in the surface this

07:04.170 --> 07:05.460
is the one that comes up.

07:05.670 --> 07:13.740
All I've done is just added a checkmark here and clicked on save user settings and that will allow this

07:13.740 --> 07:17.580
be Services Panel to be available when you're in edit mode.

07:17.730 --> 07:26.910
All right so I've drawn the grease pencil lines I've hit enter my RE Toppo object is still in edit mode

07:27.330 --> 07:31.120
and I'll click add surface and there it is.

07:31.380 --> 07:35.030
Now what it's done let me move this up here.

07:35.550 --> 07:41.520
What it's done is it's given as three edges for every grease pencil line drawn.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.800
So I want to take that down to one.

07:43.890 --> 07:49.530
And it's also given us these cross edges and I don't want any of those just to drag this down to one

07:49.530 --> 07:50.670
as well.

07:50.670 --> 07:55.050
And there is the first loop around the mouth.

07:55.050 --> 07:55.650
All right.

07:55.650 --> 07:56.490
That's good.

07:56.490 --> 08:01.290
But what I also want to be able to do is see this mirrored over to the other side.

08:01.350 --> 08:10.040
So when I come over here to the ADD modifiers menu and click on mirror and now we can see it over on

08:10.040 --> 08:16.880
the other side I'm also going to turn on unclipping because I want the center points to be sure and

08:16.880 --> 08:19.000
clip and merge together.

08:19.280 --> 08:25.090
So if you see now I can take these points and drag them and they will merge together.

08:25.220 --> 08:30.490
So I'm just going to make sure and merge them like that.

08:30.680 --> 08:38.200
This one as well and this one as well so they are exactly down the center of the character there.

08:38.730 --> 08:43.670
And what I try and do is have the points stick out of the mesh.

08:43.680 --> 08:49.810
So if they go back into the mesh like that I know they're probably too far back.

08:49.830 --> 08:55.570
Now you can use the snapping tools down here but I find it kind of slows me down.

08:55.680 --> 08:59.810
So I'm going to not use those at this particular time.

08:59.820 --> 09:00.070
All right.

09:00.090 --> 09:01.610
Let's keep moving on.

09:01.710 --> 09:07.100
I'm going to begin drawing another grease pencil line here.

09:07.170 --> 09:12.150
But you know what I think I'd like to have the B surfaces maybe over here.

09:12.150 --> 09:18.110
I don't want to keep having to switch back and forth from grease pencil to Tools tab all the time.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.440
So I think what I'm going to do is hit the End key to close this panel.

09:21.600 --> 09:28.820
I'm going to grab this little corner right here and just drag it out and if I drag it out a little bit

09:28.820 --> 09:30.390
more here let me see if I can.

09:30.390 --> 09:34.220
There there's that Tools panel right there.

09:34.370 --> 09:42.260
And if I get too close it'll go away but I just want to do it like that so that I can see it now.

09:42.270 --> 09:46.020
So over here maybe I'll have my grease pencil.

09:46.410 --> 09:50.070
And over here I'll have my b surfaces.

09:50.070 --> 09:51.450
Let's try that.

09:51.450 --> 09:56.920
So pull that up like that.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.290
All right let's try it again.

09:58.290 --> 10:05.190
I'm just going to draw one grease pencil line here at the tip of the nose right about here and just

10:05.190 --> 10:07.170
down like this.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.880
And then I'll hit enter.

10:11.200 --> 10:21.390
I'll choose this edge and then I'll come over here and hit add surface and that will extend that there.

10:21.560 --> 10:31.460
I'll take the follow down to one and then we have that piece of geometry for the bottom of the nose

10:32.480 --> 10:39.740
if you want to be able to see your read apologized mesh a little better what you can do is come over

10:39.740 --> 10:47.140
here to this object window and turn on x ray like like that.

10:47.150 --> 10:55.250
So you can see it a little better but sometimes it can fool you because you can see right through the

10:55.250 --> 11:04.620
object so I tend to have that turned off and just go by whether or not the points are outside the mesh.

11:04.670 --> 11:06.470
You can do it either way.

11:06.470 --> 11:07.850
I'll turn it off and on.

11:07.850 --> 11:10.590
Periodically just to see how I'm doing.

11:10.640 --> 11:21.040
All right so at this point what I'm going to do is take this point this vertex and move it kind of like

11:23.250 --> 11:25.600
this.

11:25.700 --> 11:33.530
And what I want to do is have this these points so I've taken this point here of that polygon and moved

11:33.530 --> 11:41.540
it down in line with these points here so that I can select this whole edge and extrude it up you can

11:41.540 --> 11:45.920
kind of see it here in the in the diagram.

11:46.130 --> 11:52.620
So I'm going to select this point and maybe else like this in a press control and click that and it'll

11:52.670 --> 12:00.500
select everything between those two points and then I'm going to go ahead and draw my grease pencil

12:00.500 --> 12:02.090
line.

12:02.390 --> 12:06.450
Maybe one right here like that.

12:07.710 --> 12:14.140
And hit enter and surface take the follow down to one.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.480
And there we go.

12:15.740 --> 12:26.510
Now I want to move these out just a bit and from this point I'm going to take this edge right here and

12:26.570 --> 12:30.350
extrude these two edges up toward the brow.

12:30.350 --> 12:34.560
So I'll just draw another line here.

12:36.060 --> 12:49.330
And one up here hit enter click and surface followed down to one and then connect him up at the middle

12:49.330 --> 13:00.170
point like that so if I click on x ray you can see what it's beginning to look like here we've got this.

13:00.240 --> 13:07.300
What I like to call a loop mask or low poly version of the character's face now.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.540
All right so let's work on the eyes.

13:09.540 --> 13:16.290
I'm just going to select this edge right here and just extrude it myself without the grease pencil you

13:16.290 --> 13:23.370
can do that of course and I'll hit E and drag out and scale that in

13:27.510 --> 13:31.010
and just put this right on the inside of the eye.

13:34.360 --> 13:41.040
I've got X-ray on still I need to turn that off so I can see when it's intersecting with the model and

13:41.040 --> 13:43.230
maybe I'll bring it in like this.

13:45.780 --> 13:53.250
All right so now what I can do is come in with the grease pencil and draw my edges around the eye so

13:53.250 --> 13:56.860
maybe one right here one here

13:59.600 --> 14:08.810
one here and these are kind of radiating out around the eye here like this and maybe one like that.

14:10.180 --> 14:16.630
So I hit Enter Slyke that edge and surface follow down to one.

14:17.110 --> 14:19.480
And if I hit x ray you can see it there.

14:21.120 --> 14:30.080
All right so now I'm going to just select these four points and hit the F key to create that face.

14:30.090 --> 14:34.870
And there we're getting that loop around the eye now and that's good that's what we want.

14:35.390 --> 14:41.780
OK let's go back to the mouth and let's draw a loop out here around the mouth.

14:41.780 --> 14:49.250
I'll hit the draw button and I'm going to begin here and just drop down around the mouth down to the

14:49.820 --> 14:53.110
middle of the chin hit enter.

14:53.180 --> 14:59.830
I'll select these edges here and hit add surface and followed down to 1.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.170
Now you can see what happened here when I extruded this.

15:03.170 --> 15:09.140
Those faces are flipped you can see they're kind of that I don't know odd gray purple color.

15:09.560 --> 15:18.830
So I'm going to select these faces select this one control select that one press the W key and choose

15:18.830 --> 15:22.980
flip normal's and that'll flip those back around.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.830
And that happens sometimes and that's fine I'll go back to Virtex moments like these two vertices and

15:30.830 --> 15:35.910
I'll press Allt em and I'll choose to merge these two points at the center.

15:36.860 --> 15:39.620
And we go and then I'll just move that back a little bit

15:42.420 --> 15:47.890
like that and let's get one more edge loop around the mouth there.

15:47.960 --> 15:55.340
So these edges are going to hook up for one of the faces of the next loop around the mouth so I'll hit

15:55.340 --> 15:57.050
the F key here.

15:57.170 --> 16:09.920
This one as well is going to connect up with these so all so like these and hit F I mean turn off x

16:09.920 --> 16:18.890
ray for a moment here and make sure that these points are poking out of the mesh like that.

16:19.290 --> 16:25.990
And now what I can do is from this point draw an edge down just under the chin here.

16:26.070 --> 16:34.630
So I'll hit the draw button come right around in here and draw that right down under the chin like that

16:35.400 --> 16:49.110
it enter and I'll select this row of edges hit add surface follow down to one and then it looks like

16:49.110 --> 16:53.260
if I hit x ray that's flipped again so I need to fix that real quick.

16:54.090 --> 17:03.940
Let me put that in the center face mode and select them w and flip normal's.

17:04.180 --> 17:12.130
And now I'm going to connect these two up so I'll just select this one shift select this point an alt

17:12.130 --> 17:14.700
in and merge these.

17:14.870 --> 17:15.860
And there we go.

17:18.960 --> 17:26.970
Let's draw another line from here down around the bottom of the chin so I'll hit draw and come down

17:26.970 --> 17:29.460
here and begin right up here.

17:31.080 --> 17:43.080
Down kind of under the chin here like so I'll hit enter all select these edges

17:47.000 --> 17:49.600
and hit add surface.

17:50.060 --> 17:52.970
Take the follow down to one.

17:53.060 --> 17:57.330
Once again those faces can't get that right.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.880
And that's fine.

17:58.880 --> 18:11.190
We just flip them around and then connect these points up here I'll hit alt in and merge at last.

18:11.230 --> 18:12.200
Let's try that.

18:13.120 --> 18:17.750
All right one more I'm going to get this row right out here.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.060
So same thing applies.

18:24.560 --> 18:29.690
A quick draw and let's draw this out.

18:30.060 --> 18:31.680
Right down underneath the chin

18:34.240 --> 18:44.800
enter edge mode select these edges and surface follow the one most likely I'm going to need to flip
