WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:06.880
Well as I said in the last video I'd like to create an eye ball to put in here so we have something

00:06.880 --> 00:10.210
to kind of sculpt around when we're working on the face.

00:10.570 --> 00:16.520
So let's just go to a brand new layer here and let's create an eyeball.

00:16.570 --> 00:21.160
First thing I guess I should do is create a sphere I'm going to create this sphere here.

00:22.880 --> 00:32.060
And I'm going to come down here and let's change this from 16 rings and 32 segments Let's change the

00:32.060 --> 00:33.960
segment to 24.

00:34.630 --> 00:36.930
See if that helps us any here.

00:37.360 --> 00:43.460
Let's change the segments instead from 16 here and 24 here to see how that works.

00:45.650 --> 00:46.890
I think that's what I want.

00:46.910 --> 00:49.210
Yeah let's go with this.

00:49.220 --> 00:53.910
So what I want to do now is rotate it so it's facing forward.

00:53.910 --> 01:01.520
So in the properties panel by pressing the N key I will come up here and rotate it around the X-axis

01:01.760 --> 01:10.720
90 degrees so it's facing forward there and to create the pupil and the iris let's tab into edit mode

01:11.320 --> 01:20.710
and I think I'll begin with this edge right here this third edge out and what I'd like to do is just

01:20.740 --> 01:24.860
insert a couple of edge loops on either side of this.

01:24.880 --> 01:29.880
So one way to do that is just press control r and insert some edge loops here and I'll just drag this

01:29.890 --> 01:36.430
so it's pretty tight against there and control are here and move it up so it's pretty tight against

01:36.460 --> 01:38.320
there as well.

01:38.320 --> 01:45.820
Now what I need to do is flatten this area right this area here is going to be completely flat.

01:45.820 --> 01:54.640
So I want to move the cursor so I can scale at this point so I'm going to Allt click this edge and press

01:54.760 --> 02:02.790
shift s and select cursor to selected and that'll move that cursor right in the center of the ring there.

02:02.800 --> 02:10.600
Now I want to select all of these points so all press control tab go to vertex mode and I'll select

02:10.600 --> 02:20.650
that one vertex in the center and then I'll press control plus to expand the selection out to that original

02:20.650 --> 02:21.700
edge.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.990
Now let me close the property panel with the key.

02:25.090 --> 02:32.500
I'll go to the side view with the three key press the five key on that number pad to go to orthographic

02:32.500 --> 02:36.970
view and the Z key to go to wireframe.

02:36.970 --> 02:45.640
Now if we zoom in here we can see that we've got our cursor right here aligned with that original edge.

02:45.640 --> 02:52.150
So what I want to do is scale from that cursor so I'll change that pivot point to the 3D cursor and

02:52.150 --> 02:58.330
then I'll change my scale tool and I'll just click and drag and move this in until it's pretty much

02:58.330 --> 02:59.010
flat.

02:59.670 --> 03:01.290
I like that.

03:01.320 --> 03:10.900
Now if we come back around here and look at it we can see that we've got this flat pupil area here.

03:10.910 --> 03:12.960
Now I want to create the iris.

03:13.380 --> 03:19.930
So the iris is going to be extruded in from here.

03:20.090 --> 03:27.230
So I'll go to face mode with control tab and then I'll just hit the three key to go to face mode and

03:27.230 --> 03:35.750
to select these faces here I can just press the C key for circle select scroll the mouse wheel to change

03:35.750 --> 03:43.010
the size of the brush there and just click and drag those faces and then right click to get out of that

03:43.010 --> 03:43.600
tool.

03:45.090 --> 03:55.340
Now I better switch back to median point for my pivot now just hit the key for extrude and click.

03:55.550 --> 04:01.180
Let me just change to the move tool and I'll just drag back.

04:01.210 --> 04:02.090
There we go.

04:02.420 --> 04:05.690
So now we've got the Irace.

04:05.690 --> 04:09.740
So there's the basis of our eye.

04:10.110 --> 04:14.960
I should probably add a subdivision surface modifier on here.

04:15.140 --> 04:25.270
We just pull this guy down a bit and add a subdivision surface and maybe increase the views to also

04:25.270 --> 04:34.320
I'll come over here to the Tools tab right here and click smooth so we get a nice smooth kind of surface.

04:34.380 --> 04:38.620
Now the edges here are collapsing I don't want that to happen.

04:38.620 --> 04:46.740
Some of insert a couple of edge loops to hold this here press control are and bring that in and insert

04:46.770 --> 04:49.010
another edge loop up in here.

04:49.950 --> 04:53.300
And maybe another one right down in here.

04:53.340 --> 04:58.030
It doesn't completely matter because this is really a temporary.

04:58.470 --> 05:03.520
So we don't have to get too detailed or perfect with it.

05:03.520 --> 05:12.450
But let me do one other thing in here what I want to do is just go into face mode and select these faces

05:12.450 --> 05:20.910
here and I'm just going to hit the e key to extrude and then hit the as to scale that in a hair something

05:20.910 --> 05:21.980
like that.

05:22.650 --> 05:24.600
So that holds it a little tighter.

05:24.750 --> 05:32.220
And I'll also come up here and choose this adjust a cage so we can see the modifier happening when we're

05:32.220 --> 05:33.330
in edit mode.

05:33.600 --> 05:39.360
So that's our basic eye if we wanted to try and get rid of this polling that's happening here we could

05:39.360 --> 05:42.780
come in and dissolve every other edge.

05:42.780 --> 05:50.220
Let me just show you what I mean here so we can select every other edge in here and change these from

05:50.220 --> 05:53.210
tri's or triangles to quads.

05:53.490 --> 06:01.920
So I could just come in here select those hit X and choose dissolve edges instead of edges and then

06:02.010 --> 06:09.090
that will change these two four sided quads and try them and help clean up that pulling that happens

06:09.090 --> 06:12.220
when so many edges come down to a single point.

06:12.540 --> 06:18.560
But as I said this is just kind of a temporary thing so we don't need to get too intricate with it.

06:18.960 --> 06:26.460
So now that we've got the I created let's take that up and put it in the character I'll shift click

06:26.460 --> 06:33.750
on the first letter to bring the character back and let's bring this up and scale it and try and put

06:33.750 --> 06:34.770
it in there.

06:34.850 --> 06:40.800
We're going to go over to my character images screen lay out and hit the three key here.

06:41.630 --> 06:49.070
And for this guy a better turn on optimal display or else it's going to be too dense and I'll just move

06:49.070 --> 06:56.240
this over here and I'm just going to try and use the character drawings as a guide to try and get this

06:56.330 --> 07:01.730
I where we needed to go and he pressed the T to get rid of that panel.

07:02.480 --> 07:11.990
So let's see I scale it a bit bring it forward some let's see how this looks.

07:11.990 --> 07:18.560
I'm going to hit the Z key like so little big you scale that down a bit

07:22.490 --> 07:25.930
I'll move this right about here and let's try this.

07:25.930 --> 07:32.880
All right let's go back to our default view and zoom in yeah I think I'm going to leave it right there

07:32.880 --> 07:36.000
for now and begin pulling these out a bit.

07:36.820 --> 07:42.880
So let me go ahead and mirror this over to the other side.

07:42.970 --> 07:45.380
I'll call this one.

07:45.790 --> 07:47.320
I left

07:50.820 --> 07:59.910
and I'm going to go ahead and apply the rotation and scale here so I'll press control a and apply the

07:59.910 --> 08:03.640
rotation and scale ago.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.540
Now what I want to do is mirror it over but I need to know that the cursor is in the center.

08:10.540 --> 08:16.780
It looks like it is going to go ahead and make sure cursor to center and then I'm going to set the origin

08:16.780 --> 08:19.380
of that object to the 3D cursor.

08:19.380 --> 08:23.250
So now the origin of the object is right down here at the center of the grid.

08:23.500 --> 08:31.030
So now when I mirror it it will mirror around that pivot point or Scuse me around the origin of the

08:31.030 --> 08:32.060
object.

08:32.200 --> 08:37.490
So click add modifier and mirror and there we go.

08:37.780 --> 08:41.760
So now it's a mirroring across the x axis.

08:41.800 --> 08:44.980
So now what I'll do is just apply that

08:47.740 --> 08:50.920
and then I'll come in here and select this.

08:50.930 --> 08:56.360
I over here in edit mode because when I applied it these became all one object.

08:56.560 --> 09:02.950
So what I need to do is just hover over this object in an edit mode and press the L key and that will

09:03.010 --> 09:07.510
select all linked faces of that piece of the object.

09:07.690 --> 09:14.180
And now I just need to hit the P key and choose separate by selection.

09:14.790 --> 09:19.110
And now that creates a whole new object for this piece over here.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.320
So now we've got I underscore.

09:22.320 --> 09:28.460
Well now this one needs to be I underscore our.

09:28.690 --> 09:34.030
And the last thing I'd like to do is just bring the origins back to these two objects so I'll select

09:34.030 --> 09:38.630
this and say set origin to geometry and there it is.

09:38.860 --> 09:41.090
And do the same thing with that over here.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.460
Now we go.

09:43.980 --> 09:51.060
So now we've got two eyes that we can use to better understand of where things on our head is going

09:51.060 --> 09:51.750
to go.

09:51.750 --> 09:59.190
There are things on the character's head I should say so in the next video we'll begin using our eyes

09:59.190 --> 10:06.780
to create the cheekbones the brows the nose and kind of finalize the structure of the face.
