Hi I'm Daryn Lyle a blender foundation certified trainer in this course.

00:05.710 --> 00:11.860
We will first bottle a base measure of our character then we will use blenders multi resolution modifier

00:12.070 --> 00:15.940
to create high resolution sculpted detail on the character.

00:16.030 --> 00:20.250
We will then use Blender's reached apology tools to create a low poly version.

00:20.470 --> 00:26.560
We will use Blender's U.V. mapping tools to create an organized U.V. map that can be exported to external

00:26.560 --> 00:30.490
paint programs like Photoshop or GIMP for texturing.

00:30.490 --> 00:35.890
We will bake normal and ambient occlusion maps and then import these into unity and test them on our

00:35.890 --> 00:41.650
character and we will look at Blender's texture painting tools and how to use them to create texture

00:41.650 --> 00:43.030
maps as well.

00:43.030 --> 00:48.400
Next you'll learn how to prep the character for rigging and generate the bass rig will create the control

00:48.400 --> 00:52.300
objects of the rig and go over how they can be used during animation.

00:52.300 --> 00:58.030
From there we will adjust the weight to the character using Blender's Virtex groups and parent the characters

00:58.030 --> 01:00.540
warhammer and shield to the rig.

01:00.550 --> 01:06.400
You'll then learn the basics of creating animations cycles for a game character will use Blender's graph

01:06.400 --> 01:12.460
editor and dope sheet to animate the idol and run animations as well as create a jump pose.

01:12.460 --> 01:17.560
Finally we will take it all into unity and write some code to get our character running and jumping

01:17.560 --> 01:18.940
through the test level.

01:18.940 --> 01:22.280
So join me as we create a game character with Blendr.
