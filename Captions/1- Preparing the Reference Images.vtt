WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:03.860
So to begin with we need a character.

00:03.860 --> 00:13.040
And what I've done is I've created a character here in GIMP and I'm calling him a teen goblin.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.020
I don't know why.

00:14.030 --> 00:17.500
I just want to do a teen goblin.

00:17.690 --> 00:26.630
I want him to be kind of tough looking but also kind of cute like he's still innocent and not quite

00:27.080 --> 00:29.100
grown up yet.

00:29.360 --> 00:33.220
So I have him here in Gimp.

00:33.230 --> 00:40.430
GIMP if you don't know is a great image manipulation program that is similar to Adobe Photoshop but

00:40.430 --> 00:42.020
it's completely free.

00:42.020 --> 00:50.450
You can download Gimp you see here at gimp dot org and I can bring up the Web site here.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.870
Here we go.

00:51.920 --> 00:58.850
You can download Gimp for just about any operating system and start drawing and painting and manipulating

00:58.850 --> 01:01.240
images all for free.

01:01.250 --> 01:08.750
So what I've done here is I've created my character and I've got him in different layers here so I can

01:09.710 --> 01:16.460
turn the layers off and on for the different parts of the character and what we'll be doing is will

01:16.460 --> 01:23.660
be cutting out the front and the side views to take into blender to use as reference images.

01:23.660 --> 01:30.680
Now of course I'm also going to be using blender which as you probably already know is a free 3-D animation

01:30.740 --> 01:37.490
suite of tools you can get that at Blender dot org right over here.

01:37.740 --> 01:41.320
All you got to do is click here and download it.

01:41.320 --> 01:49.010
Here it is free to use free to download and you can get it for just about any operating system you might

01:49.100 --> 01:50.820
imagine.

01:50.840 --> 02:00.010
Now if you want to follow along on my progress here as I go you can download this image here at my Web

02:00.010 --> 02:03.740
site at Deren Lyle dotcom.

02:03.800 --> 02:11.180
Now if you go to the home page here and then go to free tutorials you can click on this and then if

02:11.180 --> 02:19.220
you scroll down here to this little link it says you can find reference images and scene files if you

02:19.220 --> 02:20.490
click here.

02:20.870 --> 02:27.610
You'll be able to then download this team goblin character the download file is here.

02:27.620 --> 02:35.120
So this is actually the gimp file so to open this you will need to download and install GIMP on your

02:35.120 --> 02:36.790
computer.

02:36.800 --> 02:42.690
So let's start cutting the front and side views out here to bring him to Blender.

02:42.890 --> 02:44.330
Let's get the front view first.

02:44.360 --> 02:54.010
I'm going to come over here and hide the various layers that are in here except for this one front view.

02:54.340 --> 03:03.710
And I'm going to select that front view in the layers panel over here and I'll go to edit copy.

03:04.010 --> 03:13.960
And now I'm going to go to Edit Paste as a new image and if I do that it will create a new image exactly

03:13.960 --> 03:16.630
as big as the copied image.

03:16.630 --> 03:23.030
So I'm going to zoom out a bit with the minus key on the keyboard here and there it is.

03:23.110 --> 03:30.880
So I will call this front view and let's go back and get the side view.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.270
So I'll come back over here.

03:33.280 --> 03:43.160
Hide the front view turn on the side view select it and then I'll go to edit copy and then I'll come

03:43.160 --> 03:50.200
back over here to this new image and go to Edit Paste.

03:50.350 --> 03:57.780
And there he is now in GIMP when you paste a layer where you paste an image into a document.

03:57.940 --> 04:01.430
It gives you this floating selection pasted layer.

04:01.720 --> 04:07.090
And what that is it's kind of a temporary layer and you have to anchor it to something so you could

04:07.120 --> 04:10.110
anchor it to this existing layer.

04:10.390 --> 04:13.310
Or you could create a new layer for it to be anchored to.

04:13.510 --> 04:17.150
I don't want to combine it with this when I want to keep them separate.

04:17.230 --> 04:22.480
So what I'll do is all right click on this and choose two new layer.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.660
And now that will give that its own layer in the document.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.520
So I call this side view.

04:30.430 --> 04:37.300
So now I have my front view and my side view ready to be saved out.

04:37.300 --> 04:41.340
And one thing I want to do is make sure that they're aligned properly.

04:41.350 --> 04:50.440
I want the feet and the eyes and the nose et cetera to be lined up between the side view and the front

04:50.440 --> 04:51.580
view.

04:51.580 --> 04:56.070
So what I'm going to do is turn the opacity down here I'm going to click.

04:56.080 --> 05:01.630
I'm going to hover right over here and the opacity and drag this down some so that I can see through

05:01.630 --> 05:08.170
that side view and you can see the eyes were a little bit off so I'm going to zoom in and click out

05:08.170 --> 05:13.500
here and press the Z key and click and drag here to zoom in and then I'm going to come over here to

05:13.590 --> 05:16.640
move to all or the AM key.

05:16.720 --> 05:26.530
I'm just going to take the arrow keys on the keyboard and move it over so that the nose and the eyes

05:26.530 --> 05:32.980
are kind of lined up so I'm thinking something like that.

05:32.990 --> 05:38.330
I mean granted my drawing isn't perfect just not completely aligned but if I can get the bottom of the

05:38.330 --> 05:44.920
nose and maybe the mouth lined up like this as well as the bottom of the eyes.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.990
I think that might be good.

05:47.360 --> 05:54.680
Now the ear isn't lined up and that's OK I'm not too worried about that but it's the nose in the eyes

05:54.830 --> 05:56.790
that I'm concerned with here.

05:57.050 --> 06:03.320
So now that I've got that lined up I'm going to press shift to constrain it and then click and drag

06:03.320 --> 06:06.030
it back over here like that.

06:06.170 --> 06:09.150
So it's more in the center of the image.

06:09.200 --> 06:16.890
And now to zoom back out I'm going to press shift commander control J to zoom out to full screen there.

06:17.270 --> 06:20.780
I'll bring the opacity back up to 100 percent.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.360
And there he is.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.280
So now I know that they're pretty well lined up.

06:25.280 --> 06:29.070
I mean you can see that the belt isn't quite right.

06:29.210 --> 06:30.930
The feet are pretty good.

06:30.980 --> 06:36.060
Of course the hands and the arms are separate pieces in the drawing.

06:36.380 --> 06:43.160
But it looks to me like the eyes and the nose are lined up and at least for me for now that's kind of

06:43.160 --> 06:44.980
my main concern.

06:44.990 --> 06:45.680
All right.

06:45.830 --> 06:52.910
So now that I have these lined up I'm going to hide one of the layers here so I'll just deal with the

06:53.150 --> 06:54.610
front view.

06:54.620 --> 07:01.220
So now what I'm going to do is save these images out so that I can bring them into blender as reference

07:01.220 --> 07:02.150
images.

07:02.210 --> 07:16.280
So now I'll just go to file export as and I will call this gobbler in front view and it's automatically

07:16.280 --> 07:18.380
going to save it out as a P and G.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.840
That's actually what I want.

07:20.840 --> 07:29.860
You could choose from different file types here but PAGG is exactly what I want here so I'll save this

07:29.910 --> 07:36.520
all exported as a P and G and click export.

07:36.530 --> 07:39.800
Now I want to do the side view so I'll turn that on.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.990
Turn the front view off.

07:41.990 --> 07:50.430
Go to a file export as and save this as the goblin side view.

07:55.490 --> 07:56.790
And there we go.

07:56.790 --> 08:02.010
So now let's go back into blender and bring those in here in Blender.

08:02.040 --> 08:08.090
We don't need all of this stuff we don't need the camera the point like the cube at this point in time

08:08.100 --> 08:10.800
so I'll just hit the A key to select all.

08:10.830 --> 08:13.900
Hit the x key and delete.

08:13.950 --> 08:21.760
Now if you're brand new to Blender I have a couple of resources for you on my web site if you go to

08:21.760 --> 08:28.430
the home page you can see that you've got a blender Quickstart Guide here.

08:28.430 --> 08:38.120
It's a 25 page PTF file that goes over the essential tools and concepts of Blender that will kind of

08:38.120 --> 08:42.890
help you get up to speed quickly so you can follow along.

08:42.980 --> 08:50.150
In addition if you go to my YouTube channel and scroll all the way down to the bottom here you've got

08:50.150 --> 08:57.850
this blender Quickstart Guide here as well a 10 minute video that goes over much the same things.

08:57.860 --> 09:05.390
So if you get that blender Quickstart Guide PTF as well as watch this 10 minute video.

09:05.510 --> 09:12.260
You should be up to speed and ready to go to follow along in this series.

09:12.260 --> 09:12.590
All right.

09:12.590 --> 09:18.980
So let's go back to blender and what I'm going to do is bring in that front and side view into blender

09:18.980 --> 09:23.650
so that we can see it when we're in the front and inside orthographic views.

09:23.750 --> 09:27.820
Blender has a lot of different screen lay out here.

09:27.830 --> 09:30.640
One is the default which we see here.

09:30.740 --> 09:37.730
We've got U-V editing an animation and motion tracking we've got a lot of different screen layouts that

09:37.730 --> 09:45.620
come with Blendr But what I'd like to do is create a new one for my character images so I'm going to

09:45.620 --> 09:53.330
come up here and click the plus icon to create a new one it'll say default 0 0 1 and I want to call

09:53.330 --> 10:03.800
this character images now whatever I'd do to this screen layout it will save it to this screen layout

10:03.950 --> 10:07.780
selection rather than changing my default view.

10:07.790 --> 10:13.240
So I want to keep the default and have this one to change.

10:13.250 --> 10:18.320
So what I'll do is go to this little tab right up here in the very right hand corner and click and drag

10:18.350 --> 10:21.150
and drag out a new window.

10:21.290 --> 10:26.870
For now I'd like to get rid of this panel and this panel and to do that I'm going to hover over the

10:26.870 --> 10:33.380
screen and press the T key on the keyboard and that will get rid of that and the T key over here and

10:33.380 --> 10:34.970
that will get rid of that.

10:34.970 --> 10:39.690
So now I've got two of the exact same windows here.

10:39.740 --> 10:46.250
Now I can change the view or the camera that I'm viewing this through like coming down here to the View

10:46.280 --> 10:46.980
menu.

10:47.210 --> 10:57.110
And you've got the the top camera the bottom front back right left etc. and what I want is the right

10:57.110 --> 10:58.210
camera.

10:58.250 --> 11:05.340
Notice that it has a shortcut key the three key on the number pad.

11:05.720 --> 11:13.720
So if I click that it will go to the right camera and notice that it says right.

11:13.720 --> 11:20.210
Perspective there are perspective cameras and orthographic cameras and the orthographic cameras give

11:20.210 --> 11:23.690
you a very flat two dimensional view of the scene.

11:23.780 --> 11:29.540
And for this two dimensional reference image I want an orthographic camera so I'm going to come back

11:29.540 --> 11:36.860
down here to view and I can switch from the perspective to the orthographic camera with this menu item

11:36.920 --> 11:40.550
or the 5 key on the number pad.

11:40.610 --> 11:44.990
So I click that and there we have our right view.

11:45.020 --> 11:49.040
Now I want to come over here and do the same thing for the front view.

11:49.280 --> 11:55.070
So I could come down here to the view menu but for the front I've got numpad one here so I'm just going

11:55.070 --> 12:04.100
to press the one key on the numpad and then I'm going to press the five key on the numpad and there

12:04.100 --> 12:04.890
we go.

12:05.240 --> 12:13.190
Now we've got front and right orthographic views and these changes have just been applied to this screen

12:13.270 --> 12:15.140
layout that I created.

12:15.140 --> 12:18.890
If I go back to the default it's still the same.

12:18.920 --> 12:19.220
All right.

12:19.220 --> 12:20.930
So let's go back to here.

12:22.230 --> 12:29.640
Now if you don't have a number pad on your keyboard you can always emulate the number pad with the numbers

12:29.640 --> 12:37.890
on the keyboard by going to file user preferences and in the user preferences you can turn on emulate

12:37.980 --> 12:45.300
numpad and this will make the numbers on the keyboard act like the numbers on the number pad and then

12:45.300 --> 12:48.890
just be sure and click save user settings.

12:48.900 --> 12:52.810
All right so now let's bring in those images to do that.

12:52.830 --> 12:58.980
I need to bring up the properties panel for each of these windows and to do that I'll press the end

12:58.980 --> 13:07.830
key on the keyboard and if I scroll down I have this area called background images here and I'll roll

13:07.830 --> 13:08.620
that out.

13:09.550 --> 13:17.600
And click add image and now if I scroll down I have this area where I can open an image and bring it

13:17.600 --> 13:18.290
in.

13:18.290 --> 13:21.680
Now this one is only going to be for the right view.

13:21.680 --> 13:26.020
So I'm going to choose this all views menu choose right.

13:27.790 --> 13:29.050
Now and click open.

13:29.350 --> 13:38.390
And here they are so I will choose the side view right here click open and then we have our character.

13:38.410 --> 13:45.250
Now I can adjust the opacity here make him more opaque or more transparent.

13:45.280 --> 13:51.490
So I think I want to take him down to about point 3 for the opacity.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.030
Now let's do the same thing over here for the front view.

13:55.030 --> 13:56.730
We're going to press the end key.

13:56.760 --> 14:00.730
I'm going to hover over this view press the end key to bring up the properties panel.

14:00.730 --> 14:02.650
Scroll down.

14:02.650 --> 14:06.830
Roll out the background image section and click add image.

14:07.330 --> 14:10.830
And for this I want it to be the front for you.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.470
Where's the front.

14:11.470 --> 14:12.340
Here it is.

14:12.760 --> 14:16.550
And click open and bring in this front view.

14:17.830 --> 14:19.760
Then there is.

14:19.760 --> 14:25.310
Now I'm going to adjust the opacity again I put the other one at point three.

14:25.310 --> 14:26.240
Here we go.

14:26.240 --> 14:26.690
All right.

14:26.690 --> 14:32.380
So now I have my characters in the front and right orthographic views.

14:32.570 --> 14:37.690
Notice that if I go back to the default view I don't see it which is fine.

14:37.760 --> 14:43.970
In fact I like it that way so that the images don't distract me when I'm looking at it in the perspective

14:43.970 --> 14:44.750
view.

14:45.110 --> 14:51.320
So let's go back here once again to the character images and what I'd like to do is bring him up so

14:51.380 --> 15:01.670
he's actually standing on the grid here this red and green line signify this grid space here so I want

15:01.670 --> 15:07.310
those images standing on the grid so that as I create the character it will be standing on the grid

15:07.310 --> 15:08.270
as well.

15:08.330 --> 15:15.820
So I'm going to go back to character images and I want to adjust this x and y axis.

15:16.010 --> 15:24.260
So even though the three dimensional axes here say Y and Z or x and z here in the two dimensional plane

15:24.620 --> 15:30.050
we're going to be dealing with X to the left and the right and Y up and down.

15:30.050 --> 15:37.970
So I'm just going to click and drag in this view and notice that it scrolls in the X and I don't want

15:38.040 --> 15:38.530
to do that.

15:38.540 --> 15:39.530
I want the Y.

15:39.550 --> 15:46.760
So I'm going to put zero back in this field and I'm going to come over here and hover over the y axis

15:47.120 --> 15:50.530
and click and drag and move him up.

15:50.540 --> 15:53.610
So I want him to be right about there.

15:53.610 --> 15:55.720
I've got four point eight.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.400
Let's try five.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.480
That's a little too much.

15:59.510 --> 16:02.180
How about four point nine.

16:03.290 --> 16:03.830
There we go.

16:03.830 --> 16:09.240
So now I've got that foot pretty much right on the ground playing.

16:09.320 --> 16:17.380
I'll come over here and for the y axis I'll go ahead and type in four point nine as well like that.

16:17.390 --> 16:22.850
Now if you're using your own characters the numbers here may be different.

16:22.850 --> 16:29.810
So I'm going to zoom out with the scroll wheel here on the mouse and I'm going to press shift and the

16:29.810 --> 16:34.960
middle mouse button to pan or drag him up and down like that.

16:35.420 --> 16:40.100
I can zoom in with the scroll wheel on the mouse.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.090
And there we go.

16:41.300 --> 16:47.230
So now I've got my character standing on the ground plane in the front and side views.

16:47.370 --> 16:53.360
And one thing I want to do is make sure this character is actually aligned right down the center of

16:53.360 --> 17:01.160
the view here so I'm going to zoom in with the scroll wheel and press shift and middle mouse button

17:01.220 --> 17:03.520
and click and drag down some.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.960
So let's take a look at him here.

17:06.020 --> 17:08.860
He looks like he's a little bit off center.

17:09.110 --> 17:14.230
So maybe if I use this x axis I can get him more right down the center.

17:14.480 --> 17:23.570
And it looks like if I just click these arrows and take it to point one it looks like that's more directly

17:23.570 --> 17:24.860
down the center.

17:24.860 --> 17:26.320
So let's go with that.

17:26.540 --> 17:31.910
All right so I'm going to zoom out with the scroll wheel again press shift to middle mouse button to

17:32.890 --> 17:35.900
drag him up a bit and there we go.

17:36.720 --> 17:43.830
Our front and side views are going to press the End key and the key to get out of those views and we

17:43.830 --> 17:48.840
will use these as our reference images as we build our character.

17:48.840 --> 17:55.560
So in the next video we'll create the base geometry for our characters so that we can begin using Blender's

17:55.680 --> 17:56.640
sculped tools.
