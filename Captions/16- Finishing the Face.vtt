00:00.690 --> 00:03.570
Well let's continue working on the face here.

00:03.570 --> 00:12.270
I'm going to press Shift B and drag select a zoom area and zoom in here and I'm going to go to the sculped

00:12.270 --> 00:19.340
mode and I'll press alt F to center up the tumble around the head there.

00:19.950 --> 00:27.480
And the first thing I want to do I think is work on the Browns just work on how the eyes fit into the

00:27.480 --> 00:28.230
head.

00:28.350 --> 00:36.910
I'm going to press control and lightly sculpt in to build that area around the eye.

00:36.950 --> 00:45.200
I think I need to sculpt out here and I'm just using the clay strips brush right now.

00:45.370 --> 00:53.090
And I'm just trying to work very gently for now and see what I can come up with.

00:54.140 --> 00:59.460
And try and build up the guy around that eyeball.

00:59.780 --> 01:04.420
And I'm trying to keep it pretty rough right now just to try and get a sense of the forms.

01:04.580 --> 01:09.950
I'm still not really seeing in my head exactly what it needs to be.

01:09.950 --> 01:14.380
So I'm kind of I have to do some experimenting here I'm afraid.

01:14.810 --> 01:20.640
But with the eyeball in there I can kind of just build up the forms around it.

01:20.760 --> 01:28.940
I've noticed that my whole head is just a little bit too narrow here.

01:33.460 --> 01:39.280
I switch over to my character images screen layout and see how I'm doing here.

01:40.720 --> 01:49.630
And it looks like I've got some work to do on just the sheer size of the head both at the top and the

01:49.630 --> 01:55.030
sides and even the front I could bring out the front end and maybe I should work on the nose as well.

02:08.660 --> 02:15.940
And I'm just trying to use the clay strips brush to bring the nose out to about where the side view

02:15.940 --> 02:16.900
is here.

02:22.700 --> 02:25.020
Just trying to get a sense of that.

02:31.040 --> 02:37.270
And I should probably while I'm here looking at the side view get some of that brow going here.

02:48.830 --> 02:51.140
So that's a pretty good profile here.

02:51.170 --> 02:54.250
Not too bad.

02:54.260 --> 03:00.830
Let's take a look at the front view now and I'm going to tumble this around and let's see what I can

03:00.830 --> 03:01.680
do here.

03:01.880 --> 03:06.300
I feel like there's more that can be done in here in the jaw area.

03:07.500 --> 03:11.320
And I want to make it too big all right.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.460
Let's see how that looks.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.440
Now back in the default view

03:19.940 --> 03:20.280
right.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.120
Not too bad.

03:21.120 --> 03:27.750
I'm going to build out the forms around the ears just a little bit more around in here.

03:29.130 --> 03:35.780
I feel like the nose is a little big maybe could cut in on the sides here.

03:37.230 --> 03:50.340
And underneath and maybe move the nostrils down just a bit.

03:50.350 --> 03:57.970
All right so now let's start let's come back and start cutting in here and the eyes on the sides so

03:57.970 --> 04:01.330
we can see them from the side view a little bit better.

04:06.010 --> 04:16.780
And one of the things I want to do is get the sense that the eye lids are wrapping around that eyeball.

04:16.830 --> 04:17.070
All right.

04:17.070 --> 04:22.520
So we've got the brownnose kind of roughed in there.

04:22.530 --> 04:30.780
Let's also work on the lips now and once again I've gathered some reference images from online or from

04:31.080 --> 04:38.580
books just to have images of lips in front of me just so I have it it kind of in my head as I do this

04:38.840 --> 04:45.640
or hover over the lips here and press alt F to frame up the tumble around the lips here.

04:46.550 --> 04:50.470
And I'll switch over to my sculpt draw.

04:50.750 --> 04:59.720
And generally speaking the top lip has kind of three forms of one kind of in the center here.

04:59.800 --> 05:09.470
So and then two on either side here and then the bottom lip kind of has two forms down here.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.450
Like so.

05:11.700 --> 05:15.390
So that's generally speaking what I'm going to go for.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.260
So let's give that a try here.

05:18.550 --> 05:21.120
Let me try the inflate brush here.

05:21.610 --> 05:24.610
Everything else doesn't seem to be working as well.

05:26.650 --> 05:34.990
Also maybe I'll grab the crab brush and let's just try and move the mouth out just a little bit.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.880
Maybe move it back just a hair as well.

05:43.660 --> 05:47.760
It kind of wraps around the head a little bit more.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.370
And I could also maybe bring it up a bit.

05:52.800 --> 05:57.070
And also I think I want to put just a little bit of a chin on here.

05:57.570 --> 06:03.040
I think maybe I'll try the sculpt draw see if I can do that.

06:05.260 --> 06:09.080
Just want to put a little bit of a hint of a chin here like that.

06:15.760 --> 06:22.910
And I just want to maybe inflate the various areas like around the mouth here.

06:26.150 --> 06:31.010
Well there's our first go at the actual structure of the face.

06:31.070 --> 06:32.920
His character is beginning to come through.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.230
I think that is of course more to do.

06:36.260 --> 06:40.870
I'm going to want to clean up the ears and do a little more detail work on the face.

06:40.970 --> 06:47.500
But generally speaking I'm trying to get everything on the body up to a certain level of detail.

06:47.540 --> 06:51.510
Right now it's still pretty rough and I want to keep it that way.

06:51.650 --> 06:52.940
Zoom out here.

06:53.450 --> 07:02.960
Even as I begin adding the clothes and accessories he still needs boots and the arm cuffs but so far

07:02.960 --> 07:04.940
I think he's coming together.

07:04.940 --> 07:09.800
I love this part when we're actually beginning to be able to see the character and the personality and

07:09.800 --> 07:10.240
everything.
