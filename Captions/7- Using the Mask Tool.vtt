00:01.240 --> 00:03.460
Well we've just started on our sculpting.

00:03.460 --> 00:07.020
Let's go ahead and keep working on this.

00:07.030 --> 00:10.470
I think I'm going to work on the back of the legs here.

00:10.570 --> 00:18.070
One of the things I feel like I need to do is get the calves here kind of inserting into the muscles

00:18.070 --> 00:19.830
at the back of the leg here.

00:19.990 --> 00:23.510
So I'm going to use the clay strips brush here.

00:23.800 --> 00:32.140
Now one thing I need to mention I had said earlier that you can use the number keys on your keyboard

00:32.650 --> 00:36.540
as a substitute for the numbers on the number pad.

00:36.670 --> 00:42.910
If you didn't have a number pad if you were say working on a laptop and didn't have a number pad and

00:42.910 --> 00:43.990
that works pretty well.

00:43.990 --> 00:51.550
However when you begin sculpting the numbers on the keyboard become kind of useful.

00:51.550 --> 00:58.990
So what I've done is I've come over here to the user preferences and I've turned off emulate numpad

00:59.410 --> 01:08.770
so that when I'm out here in sculped mode I can hit the one key two key three key and you can see that

01:08.770 --> 01:11.890
it's changing the sculped brush.

01:11.890 --> 01:21.670
Now these correspond to one two three four five and on up and then you begin with the shift.

01:21.670 --> 01:24.400
One two three four five etc..

01:24.610 --> 01:36.770
So for me right now I'm using the three key for the clay brush the six key for the Flaten shift 2 for

01:36.770 --> 01:40.670
the pinch and shift four for the sculped draw.

01:40.670 --> 01:48.620
I just kind of have memorized those because I use them a lot and that really becomes very important

01:48.620 --> 01:54.140
as you're working and you're concentrating and you don't want to have to constantly come over here and

01:54.140 --> 01:56.810
select something out of the menu.

01:57.580 --> 02:02.680
So just wanted to mention that about the number keys on the keyboard.

02:02.680 --> 02:08.240
Some of the work just a little bit more on the muscles of the back of the leg.

02:08.290 --> 02:17.170
These muscles tend to come down to about right here and over lap on the sides and then

02:20.550 --> 02:29.120
the calves kind of insert up into these so I'm going to try and get something like that it's kind of

02:29.120 --> 02:34.190
difficult right now with the subdivisions being so low.

02:34.190 --> 02:42.170
But it's good to try and get as much as you can done at low resolution like this before you move on

02:42.170 --> 02:43.700
to the details.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.950
So I'll just try and see what I can get.

02:55.480 --> 02:55.920
All right.

02:55.920 --> 03:01.550
I feel like I've kind of hinted at that joint between those two muscles.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.960
Another prominent muscle is the one along the back here.

03:07.120 --> 03:14.710
There is kind of a ridge along either side of the spine that comes down from the base of the head down

03:14.710 --> 03:17.470
to the base of the spine here.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.740
So going to see if I can hint at that here.

03:20.740 --> 03:26.210
Just going to begin right up here at the base of the skull and work my way down.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.940
Right down to here let's say

03:39.350 --> 03:41.860
something like that.

03:41.940 --> 03:46.230
And also there's a muscle right along the side here.

03:46.260 --> 03:54.430
What many people call the obliques that run kind of from the back of the rib cage down to the front

03:54.430 --> 03:55.860
to the pelvis.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.740
So work on that too.

03:57.960 --> 04:08.870
I'm going to press the H key and click and drag to hide this arm and let's move in here and I'll begin

04:09.800 --> 04:11.330
right up in here.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.240
And kind of bring it down like that.

04:16.450 --> 04:19.280
Kind of needs to go in the front here.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.610
So it's kind of an S-curve almost

04:25.420 --> 04:26.950
and to bring that hand back.

04:26.950 --> 04:29.490
All we have to do is just press alt H.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.470
Now will bring that back.

04:32.810 --> 04:38.600
Now I think the front of the shins Here are a little bit too thick.

04:38.600 --> 04:44.060
I'm going to come in here and use the grab tool to move these back just a bit.

04:44.270 --> 04:52.460
So I'll use this grab brush and maybe increase the size of my brush here with the F key.

04:53.800 --> 05:00.880
And the strength is pretty high I'm going to bring this down some and I'll just begin clicking and moving

05:00.880 --> 05:12.730
these back just a hair very gently I have a tendency to use the grab brush a little too strong so I'm

05:12.730 --> 05:18.150
going to try my best here to ease back a bit.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.000
There we go.

05:21.040 --> 05:27.520
And that gives us a nice kind of an S curve to the leg here with the upper leg kind of curving out and

05:27.520 --> 05:30.660
then curving back for the lower leg.

05:32.290 --> 05:36.880
Now there are a couple of other landmarks that we should go ahead and add in here.

05:37.060 --> 05:44.080
I'd like to go ahead and begin with the Pecks here in the chest area and also I think we should draw

05:44.080 --> 05:45.380
in the clavicle.

05:45.670 --> 05:49.990
So first of all let's go ahead and start working on the pecs.

05:49.990 --> 05:55.990
These are usually kind of a teardrop shape that come down an insert into the area underneath the arms

05:55.990 --> 05:57.080
here.

05:57.220 --> 06:01.990
So I'm going to start by just sketching these out.

06:02.020 --> 06:06.320
Let's go over to our character images view and see how we're doing here.

06:06.340 --> 06:14.780
So it looks like I can add a little more form up here near the top like that and maybe bring that around

06:14.780 --> 06:17.490
like that.

06:17.620 --> 06:25.600
Now for the clavicle I'm going to come back to the default view again and let's draw the clavicle.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.940
I think I'll hide the head for this.

06:27.940 --> 06:35.050
So I'll press the H key and click and drag right here to draw this.

06:35.050 --> 06:41.870
I'll go ahead and use this sculpt draw brush that should give me a little bit more definition.

06:42.600 --> 06:50.840
So I'll just start here and kind of draw it out like that an S-curve see how that's going to work.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.230
Yeah something like that.

06:54.270 --> 07:02.490
I'll go ahead and press alt H and bring the head back and maybe I'll add a bit of volume to the shoulders

07:02.490 --> 07:05.360
here just so we can begin to block that out too.

07:05.730 --> 07:06.540
So to do that.

07:06.540 --> 07:15.660
What I'd like to do is draw out a mask kind of mask off the area that will be the shoulder muscles and

07:15.660 --> 07:19.620
then invert that mask to protect the rest of the model.

07:19.630 --> 07:32.880
So what I mean by that is let's go to mask here and with this on I can dry out an area that's going

07:32.880 --> 07:39.360
to represent that shoulder muscles so I can just kind of paint right on here.

07:40.830 --> 07:44.190
Where I think that shoulder muscle is going to be

07:53.360 --> 08:00.380
say it's going to be something like that to invert that mask.

08:00.380 --> 08:08.030
We can come down here to the hide mask menu and we can choose invert mask or we can use control eye.

08:08.180 --> 08:15.710
So I'm just going to click this and now you can see that the mask has been applied to everything else.

08:15.710 --> 08:21.310
If I tried to sculpt Here I'll come to the clay brush and try to sculpt here.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.200
Wouldn't do it.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.340
But I can come up here.

08:25.750 --> 08:38.830
And I can sculpt here and it will do it here so I can sculpt However I like here and protect the rest

08:39.220 --> 08:46.300
of the model so I'll just add some form here to the shoulders.

08:48.550 --> 08:56.900
And go now we're getting something there to get rid of the mask we can come back down here to hide mask.

08:57.030 --> 09:00.530
We can choose clear mask or old in.

09:01.050 --> 09:04.650
There we go.

09:04.750 --> 09:13.870
So this kind of process is what I'll be using for quite a bit of the larger muscle groups kind of masking

09:13.870 --> 09:18.490
off portions and then sculpting that area.

09:18.570 --> 09:28.230
So as another example here if I come back here to the back of the character what I'd like to do is mask

09:28.230 --> 09:31.190
off the area for the scapula.

09:31.410 --> 09:40.680
So I'll come over here to the mask reduce the brush size just a bit and I'm going to begin drawing right

09:40.680 --> 09:42.410
back here.

09:42.420 --> 09:47.800
Come down about like this loop around down here.

09:48.650 --> 09:55.410
And come back up to fit around that muscle there.

09:57.410 --> 10:00.280
So we get something that looks a little like this.

10:00.290 --> 10:05.400
So that'll be our scapula right there.

10:05.420 --> 10:07.210
Now I can press control.

10:07.250 --> 10:18.020
I then go back to the clay strips brush and do a little bit of sculpting in here to kind of hint at

10:18.020 --> 10:22.240
that structure on the back.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.570
Now this part should be kind of flat.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.960
As you look at it from the side.

10:31.260 --> 10:35.620
So I will use my flattened brush here.

10:38.660 --> 10:45.950
I'm going to go over to the Flaten and try this flatten that out a bit.

10:45.950 --> 10:52.690
So that's generally the way I'll be working masking out a structure and then building it out.

10:53.750 --> 10:54.190
All right.

10:54.190 --> 10:56.020
So we're getting there little by little.
