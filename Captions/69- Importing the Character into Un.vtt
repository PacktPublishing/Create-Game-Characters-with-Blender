WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:06.060
Well we've come a long way we're now to the point where we can bring our blender game character into

00:06.060 --> 00:15.430
unity to do that all we really need is just that blender scene filed right here that blend file.

00:15.870 --> 00:23.940
I can take this file and just click and drag it right into the assets window of unity and it'll think

00:23.940 --> 00:27.140
a bit and there it is.

00:27.140 --> 00:34.730
So what it's done is actually opened up a blender in the background used Blender's own FDX converter

00:34.730 --> 00:43.880
to convert the file to SBX and copied it here into the assets folder in our unity project folder.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.860
So now we need to work on the import settings.

00:46.940 --> 00:53.540
So I'm going to click on this file right here and you can see over here in the inspector we get a lot

00:53.540 --> 00:58.610
of information that we can adjust for importing our character.

00:58.610 --> 01:07.760
Now we've got information over here for the model for the rig and for animations I think for the model

01:07.790 --> 01:08.500
and the rig.

01:08.510 --> 01:11.670
I'm going to go ahead and leave it at the defaults.

01:11.960 --> 01:20.240
If this character were more standard in other words if it were in a t pose I might try and change to

01:20.240 --> 01:29.300
the humanoid setting here instead of generic and try and set it up so that the mechanism animation system

01:29.330 --> 01:33.340
in unity could control it better and we'd have more options.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.850
But frankly I don't think it's going to work.

01:37.100 --> 01:40.980
So I'm not going to use that.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.980
So let's go over here to the animations part and the inspector.

01:45.110 --> 01:52.010
And here's where we're going to define the individual clips that we created we created an Idol a run

01:52.190 --> 01:53.820
and a jump pose.

01:53.930 --> 01:56.440
And we're going to define those here.

01:56.450 --> 02:05.810
Now you can see Blender's already got some generic or default clips from 0 to 1 0 9 because that's the

02:05.810 --> 02:06.310
range.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.180
It found keyframes in.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.000
So it's already kind of created though is going to change or delete these.

02:12.020 --> 02:19.400
But I wanted to show you down here if you click on this little arrow you get kind of what's inside this

02:19.460 --> 02:19.970
object.

02:19.970 --> 02:25.390
And if you scroll down here like this you've got action and default take.

02:25.610 --> 02:30.590
And over here you've got action and default take this right here.

02:30.590 --> 02:37.300
These are the animation clips that we'll be using when we want to trigger the animations on and off.

02:37.370 --> 02:47.900
So we need to modify or create new animation clips that match our character and have them appear down

02:47.900 --> 02:48.700
here.

02:48.710 --> 02:52.550
So let's take a look at this first default take.

02:52.550 --> 03:00.320
Let's make this idle I'm just going to click here and change the name and call this idle and the frame

03:00.320 --> 03:09.170
range that we found back in Blendr was frame 2 to 13.

03:09.670 --> 03:14.850
And oh no that's the runs used me when you want because you can see he's changed to the run.

03:14.850 --> 03:16.050
Let's do the idle for us.

03:16.070 --> 03:19.710
Let's go 23 to 81.

03:20.030 --> 03:21.340
Let's do that there.

03:21.340 --> 03:30.230
Now he's in that idle pose and this is a looping animation so I'll go ahead and say loop time and turn

03:30.230 --> 03:37.740
on Lupo's here and then I'm going to scroll down and I'm going to click Apply Oh it looks like I put

03:37.740 --> 03:39.440
13 instead of 23.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.600
I'm sorry.

03:40.710 --> 03:43.980
Let me do that 23 and hit apply.

03:44.670 --> 03:54.160
And now we can hit play here and we can see him going through his idle animation here he goes OK so

03:54.160 --> 03:56.400
we know that that's going to work.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.230
That's good.

03:57.400 --> 04:03.700
And you can see over here that this animation clip has been changed from default take to idle.

04:03.740 --> 04:04.150
All right.

04:04.190 --> 04:04.960
That's good.

04:05.150 --> 04:10.130
So let's go back up here and let's define a new clip.

04:10.130 --> 04:13.760
I'm going to go ahead and select the action clip and just delete it.

04:13.760 --> 04:17.460
I'll hit the minus key here we don't need that.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.210
So now we can create a new one with the plus right here.

04:21.560 --> 04:30.780
And let's call this one run and for this one now it's going to be two to 13.

04:31.420 --> 04:38.470
And we go and it as well is a looping animation so I'll turn these on.

04:38.560 --> 04:43.200
We can always hit play here just to test it out and he looks pretty good there.

04:43.630 --> 04:47.420
And then I'll go ahead and click apply.

04:47.500 --> 04:47.960
All right.

04:47.970 --> 04:48.280
Good.

04:48.280 --> 04:53.150
Now we've got the run animation clip over here as well as the idle.

04:53.530 --> 04:59.250
Let's do the last one which is the jump all create a new clip.

04:59.380 --> 05:01.530
Change the name to jump.

05:02.350 --> 05:10.550
And this one I have from 1 0 1 right here 2 1 0 5.

05:10.770 --> 05:17.470
I think that now this I'm going to go ahead and leave as a single clip instead of loop time I'm going

05:17.470 --> 05:19.110
to just call this a single clip.

05:19.110 --> 05:22.080
I don't want it to loop while he's in the air.

05:22.090 --> 05:30.280
I want it to kind of transition into this single four frame clip and then transition out as he comes

05:30.280 --> 05:30.730
down.

05:30.730 --> 05:38.390
So I'm going to go ahead and leave the loop time off and I'll come over here and click Apply all right.

05:38.390 --> 05:42.880
So now we have our run jump and idle animations here.

05:42.950 --> 05:43.900
Good.

05:43.910 --> 05:48.890
So that is all inside this character object here.

05:49.190 --> 05:53.560
Now to continue setting up our character let's go ahead and just drag him out into the scene.

05:53.560 --> 06:00.350
I'll just click here and drag him into the scene and there he is now going to zero out his transformation

06:00.350 --> 06:06.920
over here and the inspector just type 0 into the X Y and Z position fields.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.690
So now he's in the center of the grid and we go.

06:10.910 --> 06:17.360
I think I could also rotate the light here so it's shining on the front of him instead of just on the

06:17.360 --> 06:18.300
back.

06:18.710 --> 06:28.190
At least for now so I'll click the light go to the rotate tool and just rotate that light around like

06:28.250 --> 06:29.350
that.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.920
You can see him a little better.

06:31.940 --> 06:35.070
All right so now let's get the textures on him.

06:35.180 --> 06:43.010
When we dragged him in from Blender we got all of these materials coming in from blender as well we

06:43.010 --> 06:49.880
got the character material we got the eyes we got the hammer and this here says checker But you know

06:49.880 --> 06:53.750
what I bet this is I bet that's the shield.

06:53.750 --> 07:01.610
All right so now what we can do is we can bring our textures in and assign them to the various slots

07:01.700 --> 07:02.390
in our material.

07:02.390 --> 07:09.230
So if I select this character material you can see we've got a slot here for Al-Bayda or the color.

07:09.230 --> 07:14.360
We've got a slot for the normal map and we've got a slot for the ambient occlusion So we're going to

07:14.360 --> 07:17.120
use these to put our textures in.

07:17.220 --> 07:26.690
I go ahead and come back to the assets window and create a new folder and call this textures and I'll

07:26.690 --> 07:30.570
open that up and let's go find our textures here.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.460
So there was our scene here is our textures.

07:37.550 --> 07:43.300
So we've got the ambient occlusion color and normal of our character.

07:43.370 --> 07:44.880
I'll go ahead and bring those in.

07:46.310 --> 07:50.300
And we've got the eyes for the character.

07:50.300 --> 07:54.330
We've got the ambient occlusion and the color of the hammer.

07:54.500 --> 08:03.640
Oh and the normal bring those in and we've got the color and the normal for the shield I'll bring those

08:03.640 --> 08:08.240
in right so we have all of our textures in there.

08:08.440 --> 08:13.240
Now we can do is we can choose our character we can come over here to the hierarchy and spin the little

08:13.660 --> 08:21.040
triangle down and we can choose the various objects within this character objects so maybe the low poly

08:21.040 --> 08:26.800
character first here is that Shater or material right here.

08:27.100 --> 08:35.120
So I'll scroll down and we can take the color for the character into the bedo we can take the normal

08:35.120 --> 08:39.440
map into the normal map slot and we always have to click fix.

08:39.440 --> 08:49.810
Now to mark it as a normal map and we take the ambient occlusion of the occlusions slot and we go areas

08:50.560 --> 08:51.700
don't look too bad.

08:52.990 --> 08:59.410
Let's bring the eyes in them and select one of the eyes open up the material and let's drag the color

08:59.440 --> 09:00.520
into the albedo

09:03.320 --> 09:10.570
select the hammer and do the same thing for this color.

09:12.990 --> 09:20.340
Normal and occlusion all it's fixed the normal map here.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.620
And then the shield looks like the shield

09:27.030 --> 09:33.480
and take these and so here it is a shield color and normal.

09:33.570 --> 09:34.650
There we go.

09:34.650 --> 09:35.530
All right.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.070
He's good to go now.

09:37.970 --> 09:38.390
All right.

09:38.390 --> 09:43.490
So the purpose of bringing this character in here in the first place was to be able to control them.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.340
So we're going to need a character controller.

09:47.660 --> 09:54.830
So I'm going to select this character here and come over here to add component and the component we

09:54.830 --> 10:01.570
want is a character control or something to go to physics and select character controller.

10:01.630 --> 10:03.030
There it is.

10:03.050 --> 10:11.360
Now we need to adjust this character controller this capsule here so it fits around our character and

10:11.360 --> 10:17.690
to do that I'm going to go to an orthographic view I'm going to click the z axis right here and then

10:17.690 --> 10:24.680
I'm going to click this instead of front perspective and switch this to an ISO or orthographic.

10:24.680 --> 10:32.540
And now let's just take this capsule and with the y axis for the center of the capsule I'm just going

10:32.540 --> 10:36.550
to click and drag on the y axis and move this up.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.200
Maybe something like that.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.720
Make sure it's on the ground there.

10:39.730 --> 10:40.330
Yeah.

10:41.130 --> 10:44.070
And I don't need it quite this wide.

10:44.930 --> 10:51.390
Let me try and bring the radius down some like so yeah.

10:51.430 --> 10:59.930
So it may be encompasses his ears and let's tumble around and make sure he's OK here.

11:00.270 --> 11:02.340
Yeah that looks like it's pretty good.

11:03.550 --> 11:09.010
So now that we have our character controller on our character we also need an animation controller or

11:09.010 --> 11:12.780
an animator controller and that's going to go right into this slot.

11:12.790 --> 11:18.730
Here you can see I've got the character selected in the hierarchy and this slot right here needs an

11:18.730 --> 11:20.290
animator controller.

11:20.290 --> 11:25.370
That's how we're going to define what animations are playing at any particular time.

11:25.390 --> 11:31.930
So to create that I just want to come down here into the assets window right click choose create and

11:31.930 --> 11:35.290
come down here and choose animator controller.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.410
And there we go.

11:36.650 --> 11:42.590
So what I can do is I can call this I can call this really anything I'll call this player control or

11:44.090 --> 11:50.270
I'll select that character and then I'll click and drag this guy right over here into that slot and

11:50.270 --> 11:51.920
then we go.

11:51.920 --> 11:58.370
Now what that does for us is if we go over here to the animator tab now if you do not have this animator

11:58.370 --> 12:06.380
tab what you can do is come up here to a window and click on animator and that will open up that window

12:06.380 --> 12:12.640
for you and then you can drag it and dock it here in this view if you want.

12:12.650 --> 12:18.830
Now you can move around in the animator by pressing alt middle mouse button here if you need to move

12:18.830 --> 12:20.360
the view around.

12:20.360 --> 12:28.460
Now what I can do is open up this character again and scroll down to my animation clips and let's just

12:28.460 --> 12:37.760
drag this idle clip right into the animator and it automatically senses the first one we dragged in

12:37.760 --> 12:44.990
it automatically hooks up to the entry and therefore if we go back here and if we turn on our game just

12:44.990 --> 12:52.010
by clicking the play button up here we're going to switch back to the scene now you can see that he

12:52.010 --> 12:55.540
is going through his idle animation.

12:55.590 --> 13:02.600
So just without doing any coding so far we've been able to get the idle animation looping and running

13:02.610 --> 13:03.970
when we turn on our game.

13:05.150 --> 13:05.860
All right.

13:06.020 --> 13:13.160
So in the next video what we'll do is we'll add the other clips to the animator and we'll define a parameter

13:13.160 --> 13:17.820
that will allow us to switch from one animation cycle to the other.

13:17.870 --> 13:18.970
So I'll see you then.
