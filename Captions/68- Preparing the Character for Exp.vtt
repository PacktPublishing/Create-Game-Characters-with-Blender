00:00.760 --> 00:06.520
Well now that we've got a few animation cycles done let's go ahead and begin preparing the scene to

00:06.520 --> 00:07.830
take it into unity.

00:08.080 --> 00:12.240
Now of course we can create more animations for our character here.

00:12.250 --> 00:18.280
We can create as many as we want but for now I think these three are good examples to take in to unity.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.860
So let's go back to the default view here.

00:20.860 --> 00:26.520
I'm going to go to the default scene view and there are a couple of things we need to do.

00:26.590 --> 00:34.120
First of all I think what I should probably do is let me go to pose mode here and just select everything

00:34.120 --> 00:36.320
so we can see our keyframes.

00:36.550 --> 00:44.530
I think what I should probably do is move everything up one frame and that so that this default pose

00:44.530 --> 00:50.660
right here is seen by unity at frame 1 or at least within the frame range.

00:50.860 --> 00:55.940
The way I have it now I'm not sure that it's going to see it at frame 0.

00:56.380 --> 01:02.320
In other words we begin at frame 1 and it would have a difficult time figuring out what the default

01:02.320 --> 01:03.430
pose is.

01:03.430 --> 01:09.650
So what I think I should do is take everything up in one frame so I will go back to the animation view

01:10.150 --> 01:13.930
all go to the dope sheet up here and select everything.

01:13.960 --> 01:19.830
And in fact what I'm going to do is I'm a press control up arrow and so we can see the whole thing here.

01:20.050 --> 01:23.110
And this is all the keyframes for our character.

01:23.220 --> 01:27.490
And I'm just going to move the cursor up to frame one so I can see what I'm doing and I'll just hit

01:27.580 --> 01:30.880
G and slide it over.

01:31.330 --> 01:37.210
So I get my default pose on frame 1 I'll press control up here again to go back.

01:37.210 --> 01:45.850
So now if we take a look here I'm going to zoom out and actually what I'll do is I'll go from frame

01:45.870 --> 01:49.750
1 To what do I have here one 10 maybe.

01:49.800 --> 01:56.850
Let's try that and I'll press the home key and on the keyboard to zoom into the entirety of the timeline

01:56.880 --> 01:59.440
there are the frame range.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.260
So you can see on frame 1.

02:01.260 --> 02:05.490
I've gotten my default pose and then it goes straight into the run.

02:05.940 --> 02:08.660
A I have the idol here.

02:08.670 --> 02:12.040
But take a look at the idol look at what's happening here.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.800
Wat happened.

02:14.640 --> 02:20.750
So if I play this here let me de-select on this if I play this watch what happens.

02:22.930 --> 02:24.100
That's not good.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.880
See how he's sliding there.

02:27.370 --> 02:29.470
OK so I need to work on that.

02:29.470 --> 02:33.160
Let's take a look at where those frames are.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.330
It looks like it begins here.

02:37.190 --> 02:44.090
At frame twenty three now and goes out through frame 82.

02:44.120 --> 02:53.410
So the reason why I get those strange sliding effects is because I don't have these key frames anchored

02:54.370 --> 02:56.300
here on this frame.

02:56.320 --> 03:02.590
It goes slowly from here all the way to the default pose again over here.

03:02.590 --> 03:11.620
So what I need to do is just copy these and move them over to hold the pose for these particular controls

03:11.620 --> 03:14.890
so this is the root and the torso.

03:15.040 --> 03:20.720
So I can take these and shifty and move them on over these as well.

03:20.720 --> 03:25.080
Here I've got these that don't have an anchor here at the end.

03:25.290 --> 03:33.720
So just shifty and move these over and then it looks like I've got a large group down here that hasn't

03:33.720 --> 03:38.910
been anchored at the end as well so I'm just going to hit the B key and border select all of these.

03:39.060 --> 03:42.360
And now I can press shift D and move them all the way down.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.130
And there we go.

03:44.130 --> 03:52.230
So we've anchored these poses for these control or this position I should say for these controls at

03:52.230 --> 03:54.340
the end of the cycle as well.

03:54.360 --> 03:58.350
So I'm in press control up arrow and go back.

03:58.350 --> 03:59.360
Where did I begin.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.190
23 was that right.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.360
There he goes.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.570
Looks a little bit better.

04:04.570 --> 04:10.620
Now he goes into his jump pose but there's the idle jump and the run.

04:10.690 --> 04:13.660
OK so that looks a bit better.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.640
Now that we've got our keyframe set up I need to figure out what the frame ranges are because we're

04:18.640 --> 04:25.270
going to need that information in unity to be able to break these animations out into their individual

04:25.270 --> 04:27.900
components into their individual clips.

04:27.910 --> 04:34.020
We're going to need to know what the frame ranges are here in Blendr and type that into unity.

04:34.060 --> 04:36.900
So it knows how to split out the animations.

04:36.910 --> 04:48.250
All right so it looks to me like it looks like it's going to be two two 13 here and then it looks like

04:48.250 --> 04:53.180
it's going to be 23 to 82.

04:53.430 --> 05:01.590
And also we've got our POWs out here at 101 and for the jump podium actually didn't need more than one

05:01.590 --> 05:08.470
frame so I'm going to select all of these frames and duplicate them and I'll move them up to frame one

05:08.470 --> 05:09.650
to five here.

05:09.660 --> 05:15.760
So I have 101 to 105 for my jump animation.

05:15.840 --> 05:16.420
All right.

05:16.420 --> 05:18.820
When you hit control up there are to go back.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.300
So now we know what our frame ranges are going to be.

05:22.350 --> 05:23.050
That's good.

05:23.070 --> 05:25.650
I'm going to go back to my default view here.

05:26.010 --> 05:30.510
All right so now what we need to do is bake our animation.

05:30.510 --> 05:37.600
We've got a lot of constraints and controls that that unity is just not going to understand.

05:37.920 --> 05:44.320
But what we need to do is bake the animation out so there's a key frame here for every frame.

05:44.490 --> 05:52.770
So unity doesn't have to rely on Blender's constraints and tweeting between the keyframes it'll be able

05:52.770 --> 05:57.740
to understand what's going on a lot better if it has a keyframe for every single frame here.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.010
So how do we do that.

05:59.010 --> 06:06.090
Well you got to do is go into PPO's mode select everything with a key so that all the controls are selected

06:06.380 --> 06:13.450
and then come over here to pose go to animation and go to take action.

06:13.450 --> 06:14.050
There we go.

06:14.050 --> 06:21.340
So now we've got this little window so we can choose to take the data from pose or object I'm going

06:21.340 --> 06:23.910
to choose PPO's since we're in PPOs mode here.

06:24.040 --> 06:30.820
And the frame range from 1 to 110 and we want keyframe on every frame.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.230
So I'll just click OK.

06:33.900 --> 06:37.520
And then we go you can see you've got a keyframe now on every single frame.

06:37.590 --> 06:44.300
And if I scroll through these they're doing all these animations and everything and that's great.

06:45.050 --> 06:52.790
So now that we've got a keyframe on every frame and you'll notice that there's not one beyond here because

06:52.970 --> 06:55.880
it doesn't change any and that's fine.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.080
All right so the next thing we need to do is kind of clear out the scene.

06:59.090 --> 07:05.600
We've got a lot of junk over here things that we just don't need now that we've baked the animation

07:05.600 --> 07:07.400
out.

07:07.550 --> 07:10.360
All of this we can get rid of.

07:10.580 --> 07:19.160
And there's a lot here if you look through the outliner and these W.G. t widget objects are filling

07:19.160 --> 07:25.980
the outliner we need to select all of these and just delete them so you can come in here and select

07:25.980 --> 07:29.180
one and press shift and select another.

07:29.250 --> 07:34.920
And for most programs if I came down here and press shift and clicked it would select everything in

07:34.920 --> 07:38.670
between here but blender doesn't do that.

07:38.670 --> 07:40.920
No indeed it does not do that.

07:41.130 --> 07:46.230
So what you can do to select everything is just to use the borders select tool.

07:46.290 --> 07:52.710
So I'll press the key and click and drag and that will select everything there and then I can scroll

07:52.710 --> 07:57.980
down and hit the and click and drag and that'll select all of those.

07:57.980 --> 08:05.450
So if your screen is bigger and you can and you can see more of the outliner than I can here you can

08:05.450 --> 08:06.920
select more all at once.

08:06.930 --> 08:14.390
So I'm just going to go through and select everything here with the key and the border select and we

08:14.390 --> 08:23.070
go so I've just selected all of the W.G. objects and I'll just right click and choose delete.

08:23.290 --> 08:24.160
And there we go.

08:24.370 --> 08:29.050
Now if we hit play we should see that it didn't affect really anything.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.820
So that's good.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.170
Everything's still there.

08:33.170 --> 08:36.710
The next thing we don't need is this meta rig.

08:36.710 --> 08:43.900
This is the rig that was originally created that we use to place the joints of our rig.

08:43.910 --> 08:47.300
We then generated the actual rig from from that.

08:47.300 --> 08:51.450
So we don't need this either so we can right click and delete that.

08:51.470 --> 08:59.320
So now all we're left is just the rig and let's just make sure once again it plays Everything's there.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.890
That's good.

09:00.890 --> 09:03.440
All of our keyframes are there.

09:03.530 --> 09:04.610
All right.

09:04.910 --> 09:05.860
So that's good.

09:06.140 --> 09:08.090
So let's go ahead and save the scene.

09:09.130 --> 09:13.840
So we are ready to take our character into unity and into the next video that is exactly what we'll

09:13.840 --> 09:14.720
do.

09:14.740 --> 09:15.370
So see them.
