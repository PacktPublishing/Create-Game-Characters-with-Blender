WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:02.010
Well we're getting pretty close.

00:02.010 --> 00:06.940
Now we've got most of the pieces modeled and sculpted.

00:07.050 --> 00:15.780
The one thing that I really need to do here is this shoulder armor thing I did this some time ago and

00:15.780 --> 00:17.160
I'm not really happy with it.

00:17.160 --> 00:21.740
It basically looks like half of a sphere squished and extruded.

00:21.750 --> 00:24.010
And that's exactly what it is.

00:24.150 --> 00:29.970
And I'll tell you I think one of the reasons why it turned out like this and that I'm not pleased with

00:29.970 --> 00:37.770
it is because I didn't use any reference images I didn't go out and search for images like these to

00:37.770 --> 00:38.450
help me.

00:38.490 --> 00:39.880
Grounded in reality.

00:39.930 --> 00:45.290
I was just looking at the drawing I made so I'm not happy with it.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.990
I want to do it again.

00:47.220 --> 00:52.410
So I'm just going to hit X and delete now.

00:52.560 --> 01:02.220
I think what I want to do is use the read typology tools again just to get a base mesh of the shoulder.

01:02.220 --> 01:04.480
I just want to do that.

01:04.530 --> 01:13.730
So what I'm going to do is just go to the body here and I'm going to come in here and use those read

01:13.730 --> 01:15.960
apology tools again.

01:15.960 --> 01:21.600
So before we draw anything out on the shoulder here with the grease pencil Let's go ahead and create

01:21.600 --> 01:24.780
one of those empty objects that we used before.

01:24.960 --> 01:32.130
When I come over here to the Create tab and just create a cube and that's down here now I'm going to

01:32.130 --> 01:39.210
hit the tab key and I just want to collapse all of these vertices down into one point.

01:39.390 --> 01:43.520
I don't need it to have any surface at all.

01:43.530 --> 01:52.130
So with the cube in edit mode and in vertex mode here I'll press alt M and choose at center.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.910
And now that's collapsed into one point.

01:55.270 --> 01:57.390
Let's find that object here.

01:57.390 --> 01:58.650
There it is.

01:58.650 --> 02:01.790
I'll just call this shoulder armor.

02:02.070 --> 02:06.210
And so now we have this point in edit mode here.

02:06.270 --> 02:06.540
All right.

02:06.540 --> 02:10.500
So let's go over to the grease pencil and with this.

02:10.510 --> 02:20.160
Now I need to create a new greased pencil data block and I need to draw on the surface of the object

02:20.160 --> 02:22.360
so I click surface.

02:22.380 --> 02:27.280
Make sure that object is selected and click draw.

02:27.870 --> 02:31.680
So now we've got a new grease pencil layer here.

02:31.680 --> 02:39.180
We're drawing on the object on the surface so I should be able to come in here and now draw the beginnings

02:39.180 --> 02:44.360
of my geometry for the shoulder armor here so I'm just going to draw a straight across here.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.860
And then draw straight across here.

02:49.520 --> 03:01.660
And then I'll add a couple of edges this way something like that Tenafly tumble around we can see that

03:01.660 --> 03:07.810
those grease pencil lines have conformed to the character's shoulder.

03:07.810 --> 03:14.380
All right so now that I have those I'm going to press Enter I'll go back to my tools tab and I'll just

03:14.650 --> 03:20.360
roll up the transform section here and roll up the mash section.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.220
And now I can see the B surfaces a little better.

03:24.220 --> 03:31.370
So now I should be able with my shoulder armor selected and it in edit mode.

03:31.550 --> 03:35.920
I should be able to hit add surfaces and there we go.

03:36.150 --> 03:42.180
Now it's got new geometry here for the beginning of that shoulder pad.

03:42.420 --> 03:49.650
I need to see it a little better so I'll come over here to the object window and scroll down and choose

03:49.710 --> 03:53.980
x ray so we can see that a little better now.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.390
All right.

03:54.390 --> 04:04.050
So what I want to do is select this edge and extrude it on up over the shoulder up to here I think and

04:04.050 --> 04:10.320
then I'll just use this as the base geometry to then create something kind of like this or maybe like

04:10.320 --> 04:10.640
that.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.320
I'm not sure yet.

04:12.570 --> 04:16.600
Let's go back to the grease pencil and let's click draw.

04:16.650 --> 04:23.660
And what I want to do is just then extend this geometry up to the shoulder area right up in here.

04:23.730 --> 04:28.000
So I click draw and now I'm just going to extend this up to here.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.730
Maybe like this

04:33.360 --> 04:43.950
this and I'm just trying to get the basic shape of the object that's all yeah let's work let's work

04:43.950 --> 04:45.510
with that.

04:45.520 --> 04:45.820
All right.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.930
So I'm going to press the enter key.

04:48.160 --> 04:54.640
I'm going to come back over here and go to edge mode and select these edges.

04:54.740 --> 05:02.750
And now if I go back to my tools tab and click add surfaces I can just extend that on up over the shoulder.

05:02.750 --> 05:10.880
Now I don't need that many polygons again all reduce reduced follow to 1 and that'll give me a nice

05:11.180 --> 05:15.890
beginning I think to what will be the shoulder pad there.

05:16.310 --> 05:23.000
All right so I'm going to tab out of edit mode and there we have our shoulder piece.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.930
I will hit the end key to move it to a new layer.

05:26.930 --> 05:29.230
I'll just move it to layer 3 here.

05:30.950 --> 05:35.550
Riego and now I've got this piece that I can work with.

05:35.830 --> 05:43.690
I want to go ahead and turn off the mat cap simply because I don't know I just feel like it.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.730
Now I want to see it in that gray shading.

05:46.750 --> 05:51.460
I don't know I just feel like I'm more used to that when I'm polygon modeling.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.000
I don't know why.

05:53.560 --> 06:00.060
I think I'll move the pivot point back to the geometry so I'll come over here to the tools tab click

06:00.060 --> 06:03.440
Set origin and move the origin to the geometry.

06:03.850 --> 06:05.740
So there it is.

06:05.740 --> 06:11.410
And if I hit the period key you'll notice that it doesn't really frame up the object here.

06:11.740 --> 06:18.490
Well the problem is is there still a point down here I can tap into Edit Mode go to vertex mode and

06:18.490 --> 06:20.670
wait and here there's a little point.

06:20.770 --> 06:29.140
So if I can just hit X and choose vertices get rid of that then hopefully if I go back to object mode

06:29.170 --> 06:31.290
and hit the period key it'll zoom into it.

06:33.610 --> 06:41.650
All right so here is the beginnings of our shoulder armor from here it's just a matter of using good

06:41.650 --> 06:46.250
old fashioned polygon modeling to get it the way we want it to look.

06:47.570 --> 06:51.100
So what I'm going to do is begin over here.

06:51.100 --> 06:58.630
And I think I just want to get one more extrusion over the shoulder here maybe I'll bring back the character

06:58.630 --> 07:01.210
so I can see a little better.

07:01.570 --> 07:06.310
And I'm just going to bring it up and maybe over a bit.

07:08.990 --> 07:13.670
So I can see the shoulder armor above the shoulder there.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.310
Let's also see where that strap is.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.250
Bring back that layer.

07:18.260 --> 07:22.580
All right so the strap is pretty high up it's higher than I would have expected.

07:22.580 --> 07:26.690
I'm going to need to extrude this out one more time.

07:26.690 --> 07:33.970
So let me go back to edge mode here and select these and extrude and pull that up.

07:35.030 --> 07:41.130
So yeah we get something like that to cover where it's going to meet with the strap.

07:42.080 --> 07:48.140
So what let's do now is just select this edge and extrude it down and over the front of the shoulder

07:48.140 --> 07:48.890
here.

07:49.280 --> 07:59.960
So if I select these edges here and then extrude down around the shoulder they'll just hit me and extrude

07:59.960 --> 08:01.470
this once and down.

08:05.250 --> 08:09.660
Maybe move it over a bit.

08:09.740 --> 08:17.690
I think it needs one more hit me and pull it down a bit.

08:17.750 --> 08:26.340
I'll do the same thing over the back.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.300
And let's pull it down.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.330
You again

08:41.810 --> 08:47.700
I'm also going to grab these two edges I think and extrude these down as well.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.630
So

08:55.220 --> 09:00.050
and maybe over here to connect up with the strap here.

09:03.360 --> 09:08.730
So now let's go ahead and figure out how tall this needs to come up here.

09:08.730 --> 09:16.510
I'd like it to come up a bit to protect the neck if we can use this edge right here.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.840
And let's extrude this straight up

09:22.930 --> 09:23.740
like that.

09:26.770 --> 09:32.230
And then go to our Virtex mode here and I'm just going to bring these pieces down so they're not quite

09:32.230 --> 09:33.040
as high.

09:37.140 --> 09:41.260
Now I think I'd like to start shaping this area a little better now.

09:41.430 --> 09:48.240
So I'm going to go to Virtex mode and I'm just going to begin pulling points and tell and see if I can

09:48.240 --> 09:52.750
get a basic shape here that I like.

09:54.470 --> 09:56.360
Sometimes this is just what you need to do.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.030
Just start pulling points and seeing what happens.

10:06.310 --> 10:10.710
Right go ahead and add a subdivision surface modifier and see what happens.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.360
I don't honestly know what's going to happen here.

10:13.570 --> 10:14.930
But let's give it a try.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.920
And always smooth it a bit.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.510
All right so that looks pretty good.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.010
But let's go into edit mode here.

10:24.830 --> 10:29.570
And I'm going to select the edge all the way around.

10:29.720 --> 10:37.570
Just going to hold shift and alt and click these edges all the way around.

10:37.710 --> 10:49.890
And I think I'll just extrude and click and I'm going to drag straight down and move it a bit.

10:49.890 --> 10:51.030
Now let's just test this.

10:51.030 --> 10:56.760
Let's add a few edge loops along here and see what happens.

10:56.850 --> 10:59.880
See if that holds that pretty well.

11:01.070 --> 11:02.660
Yeah it's beginning to.

11:02.880 --> 11:07.730
This is kind of rounded here I'd like it a little more pointed if I could.

11:08.220 --> 11:10.890
But let's see if we can do with that.

11:11.940 --> 11:14.300
Yeah I think we're getting there.

11:14.310 --> 11:18.070
I think that's beginning to look a little better than the last time.
