00:00.860 --> 00:08.240
Well in the last video we took a look at using the jitter and spacing tools to give some randomness

00:08.240 --> 00:10.050
to our brushstrokes.

00:10.100 --> 00:19.520
What I'd like to do is this time add a texture to the brush that will help give it some detail or randomness.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.070
Let's give that a try.

00:21.080 --> 00:29.240
So I'm going to come down here to the texture area right here and I'm going to click new and create

00:29.300 --> 00:31.960
a new texture for the brush.

00:32.120 --> 00:35.940
So I click new and I get this black texture.

00:35.960 --> 00:45.140
I'll give it a name instead of texture 001 let's call it let's call it noise about noise brush.

00:45.260 --> 00:50.300
And now if we go over here on the right side let's do this.

00:50.910 --> 00:58.880
In the materials here is the material that we've been working on right next to that is the texture layers.

00:59.160 --> 01:04.230
And here's the texture layers that correspond to our texture slots.

01:04.230 --> 01:10.590
So if we go over to our slots we can see we've got a base color the the normal map and that details

01:11.310 --> 01:15.470
texture slot and that's what we've got here we've got the base color the normal map.

01:15.480 --> 01:20.760
And this is actually the details one that we could call that.

01:20.970 --> 01:27.900
So those are our texture layers and that's for our material but we can come right over here to the brush.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.620
And now we can create a texture for our brush.

01:31.620 --> 01:39.960
So for this instead of an image or a movie for our noise brush Let's choose.

01:40.170 --> 01:41.780
We could choose all kinds of things.

01:41.790 --> 01:45.030
These are procedurally generated textures.

01:45.150 --> 01:50.280
We've got noise clouds marble.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.380
Let's take a look at clouds here.

01:53.130 --> 01:55.890
That looks kind of interesting.

01:56.130 --> 01:58.320
Let me look at Stucky here.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.120
Yeah it's not bad or we could go with noise too.

02:04.460 --> 02:06.690
Noise to me looks a little too dense.

02:06.690 --> 02:09.710
Let me let me go with.

02:09.760 --> 02:14.350
Let's try this Stucky Yeah let's try that.

02:14.640 --> 02:21.460
So now we've selected that if we go back to the Tools tab we can see that that is in our brush texture.

02:21.780 --> 02:25.900
Now what I'm going to do is brush mapping here.

02:25.910 --> 02:29.030
The default is often view plane.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.680
I'm going to change it to random.

02:31.680 --> 02:40.260
So it lays down this texture in kind of a random way and I'll come back up and I'll choose a lighter

02:40.260 --> 02:43.350
color maybe something like this.

02:43.350 --> 02:46.170
Now these are palettes I don't know if I've mentioned this.

02:46.170 --> 02:52.500
You can sample colors and create a new palette by just clicking on the plus icon.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.220
Here are the plus button.

02:54.360 --> 03:02.060
So if I created a new color something like this I could just hit plus create a new palette.

03:02.070 --> 03:10.270
And now that color would be there for me to sample any time you can create multiple palettes down here.

03:10.560 --> 03:17.670
Let me move this out here so I've got one palette here I've got another palette here doesn't really

03:17.670 --> 03:19.300
have anything in it.

03:19.620 --> 03:27.010
I could create a new palette or a new sampled color for this palette as well.

03:27.360 --> 03:33.670
And you can give the different palettes names things like that so I'll just go back to my original and

03:33.760 --> 03:37.780
we go and I'll select that color here.

03:38.730 --> 03:39.090
All right.

03:39.100 --> 03:44.120
So now I'm going to zoom in to that belt.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.480
I want to do this I want to work on this belt here.

03:47.480 --> 03:54.400
If I hit the F key and zoom out a bit I'm going to increase the size of my breast just a bit.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.850
And let's take a look at how the stroke is.

03:57.870 --> 04:05.940
If I drag you can see that it lays down this texture in kind of a random way as I stroke.

04:06.030 --> 04:09.020
And that's kind of what I'm looking for here.

04:09.060 --> 04:11.800
Let me take the strength down a bit.

04:12.420 --> 04:18.500
Let's also take a look at the spacing see if this does anything for us.

04:18.810 --> 04:22.230
And it does it really space's it out quite a bit.

04:22.230 --> 04:25.290
So let's let's try around 100

04:27.810 --> 04:34.200
and maybe a little bit lower and Riego something like that.

04:34.220 --> 04:43.210
So now what I want to do is lay down this texture on the belt strap in kind of a sloppy way I'm going

04:43.210 --> 04:47.210
I just want to just scatter it around all over the belt.

04:47.240 --> 04:50.980
So what I'm to do is use this face mask selection again.

04:50.990 --> 04:57.560
I'm going to hit the A key to de-select everything and then I'm going to hover over the belt and press

04:57.590 --> 05:05.300
l and that will select that whole thing based on our seems that we created when U-V mapping.

05:05.330 --> 05:15.750
Now I can come in and just begin in a relatively sloppy way I just began laying down that texture.

05:15.770 --> 05:20.710
So since it's masked off I don't accidentally get it on the rest of the model.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.490
Now that may be a little bit too much.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.640
Let me back off there.

05:24.860 --> 05:27.010
Turned down the strength.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.910
Reduce the size a bit.

05:29.210 --> 05:30.300
And now let's try it.

05:33.570 --> 05:35.250
Yeah something like that.

05:35.670 --> 05:38.400
So it's going to go over this whole area like this.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.210
Just to give it a little bit of extra interest

05:49.600 --> 05:55.090
All right I've got that done I think I'm going to go through with yet another color and see if I can

05:55.450 --> 05:58.320
add just a little bit more to it.

05:58.330 --> 06:06.160
I like the fact that this leather texture has multiple colors in it that kind of multiple splotches.

06:06.160 --> 06:11.480
So if I hold the key down let me see what kind of color I can sample here.

06:12.040 --> 06:16.030
Maybe something a little darker this time.

06:16.030 --> 06:18.830
Kind of like that.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.960
Let me try this one.

06:21.040 --> 06:27.630
So in a similar way I'm going to go through and just scatter some texture down on the belt.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.120
But this time I think I want to make the brush stroke pretty small.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.040
Let me see how this works.

06:33.160 --> 06:41.390
And also I'll take the spacing and increase it even more and maybe even the jitter a little more as

06:41.410 --> 06:43.190
well and let's see what happens.

06:45.690 --> 06:48.180
Yeah I can see it going down a little bit there.

06:48.180 --> 06:53.730
Yeah I kind of like that it kind of works it kind of blends in very very lightly.

06:53.730 --> 06:58.960
I don't know if you can see that but I kind of like what it's doing.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.980
Let me give it a little more strength here a little less spacing a little less jitter.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.720
And something like that.

07:09.750 --> 07:17.820
I just wanted to give it something a little bit more I'm not a big fan of just solid blocky colors so

07:18.040 --> 07:25.480
I'd like to have some sort of multiple layers and colors in the textures.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.090
All right.

07:26.100 --> 07:26.730
That's good.

07:26.730 --> 07:32.330
And I think one the last one I want to really like color in there.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.930
Let me try this one here.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.150
And actually take it up a little bit lighter

07:42.380 --> 07:43.310
something like that.

07:43.310 --> 07:46.310
So it's very very light.

07:46.330 --> 07:47.190
Let me try this

07:51.670 --> 07:54.140
well that's too much too much.

07:54.220 --> 07:55.130
Back it off.

07:56.630 --> 07:58.560
Back it off.

07:58.610 --> 08:09.510
Make it a little bigger try this.

08:09.630 --> 08:10.770
Something like that.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.670
Just so it's a little worn as well.

08:15.060 --> 08:23.880
Now as I'm looking at this I was just noticing that these metal buttons have some really nice colors

08:23.880 --> 08:31.710
to them that I think I could maybe use for the buckles and maybe even the shoulder armor.

08:31.950 --> 08:37.910
Well I'll go out and look for some other ones as well but these colors are kind of nice.

08:37.950 --> 08:46.380
So maybe in the next video we'll take a look at using these colors and working on the metal armor pieces.

08:46.380 --> 08:52.480
Now one thing I should mention before we go is that I haven't yet saved this text slot.

08:52.500 --> 08:58.980
You can see the asterisks here so if I saved the scene and close the scene I would lose that information

08:58.980 --> 09:01.090
that I just painted.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.840
I would lose all of this.

09:02.940 --> 09:05.610
So be sure and save your image.

09:05.610 --> 09:09.230
It's a real pain when that happens.

09:09.300 --> 09:16.470
But since I've already saved this image once I can come over to the slots tab and click on Save all

09:16.470 --> 09:21.310
images and that will save any changes to any of the slots I have here.

09:21.450 --> 09:29.220
So I'll save all images and that should take away the Asterix for all of these paint slots.
