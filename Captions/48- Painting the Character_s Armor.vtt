00:01.170 --> 00:02.200
This is in life.

00:02.220 --> 00:02.940
Welcome back.

00:02.940 --> 00:10.170
Let's take a look at this armor now or the buckle and the shoulder armor.

00:10.650 --> 00:17.430
As I said before I'd like to maybe use these colors here for these pieces.

00:17.430 --> 00:21.350
I also have another reference image that I kind of liked.

00:21.450 --> 00:29.400
The problem with reflective materials is that it so much depends on the lighting and the environment.

00:29.730 --> 00:34.750
So let me just open up this one and let's take a look at this one.

00:35.050 --> 00:37.760
Here it is Renaissance half armor.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.690
Let me take a look at that.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.400
So here's the armor.

00:42.520 --> 00:52.330
And you can see that so much of it is the orange lights in the room whereas this one really has a different

00:52.330 --> 00:54.850
color of light to the room.

00:54.940 --> 01:02.640
So I'm going to try and use both or at least I want to have them both up so I can use them as needed.

01:02.770 --> 01:07.410
But I really like this these colors here.

01:07.490 --> 01:08.680
Let's give it a try.

01:09.020 --> 01:16.340
I'm going to come over to the model and with the face masking turned on I'm going to hit the A key and

01:16.340 --> 01:23.540
then I'm going to hover over the buckles hit the L key and the shoulder armor and hit the L key and

01:23.570 --> 01:31.140
then I'm going to come in here and hit L to catch these side pieces here.

01:31.670 --> 01:36.260
And I'll also add these parts up here.

01:36.290 --> 01:36.790
OK.

01:36.800 --> 01:41.450
So and L there so now I should have them all selected.

01:41.450 --> 01:48.660
And now I can begin thinking about how to lay some color down here to get this kind of kind of a look.

01:48.860 --> 01:55.010
This color is fairly dark but I think we can find some darker colors in here.

01:55.010 --> 02:04.330
Let me hold the key down and I'll try and sample one of these colors here something like this so I'll

02:04.330 --> 02:09.030
switch to this color maybe make it even a little darker.

02:09.120 --> 02:17.110
Let me see what kind of texture I still have the noise brush texture on it and my jitter and spacing

02:17.110 --> 02:19.490
are reasonable I guess.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.160
Let's see if we can do with this.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.610
I'm going to zoom in a bit.

02:22.690 --> 02:29.140
Now I have the belt pushing through the buckle here and I'll fix that soon.

02:29.140 --> 02:32.790
I just need to go into edit mode and pull that point back a bit.

02:32.920 --> 02:38.760
But since I have the leather belt masked off I shouldn't be painting on that in any way.

02:38.830 --> 02:43.300
So let's just see what happens I'll just do a stroke here see if anything happens.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.820
Not much.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.090
Let's increase the strength.

02:46.090 --> 02:47.280
See what happens.

02:47.590 --> 02:53.050
OK so now we can begin to see it may reduce the strength a bit.

02:53.290 --> 03:02.010
And I just want to come in here to the creases and maybe just add a little bit of darker color in here.

03:03.790 --> 03:07.110
And maybe around the inside as well.

03:08.090 --> 03:09.540
Something like that.

03:09.740 --> 03:17.090
I'm also going to hover over the belt buckle and press alt F and that'll center my cursor up or center

03:17.090 --> 03:19.090
that object up in the view.

03:19.280 --> 03:29.510
And now as I tumble I'll tumble around that object so I continue laying down some of the darker color

03:29.510 --> 03:31.200
here.

03:31.250 --> 03:40.150
I'll turn the spacing down even more too much bring that up.

03:41.170 --> 03:42.550
Reduce the strength a little bit.

03:42.550 --> 03:50.000
So it's all a balancing act to see which you can get.

03:50.020 --> 03:57.340
So now that I've got some of that darker color in here to try and sample some of that there's some bluish

03:57.340 --> 03:58.030
color in here.

03:58.030 --> 03:58.980
There it is.

03:59.020 --> 04:08.590
You can see it coming up in here as I hover over it with the keyhole to me as key down something like

04:08.590 --> 04:09.270
that.

04:12.430 --> 04:14.590
Let me try and get in here.

04:14.590 --> 04:19.930
I'm going to increase the size of the brush and let me just see what happens if I do this.

04:19.930 --> 04:21.990
Yeah that kind of lays it down nice.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.980
I like that one to reduce the strength to a little more and just come in here and add some of that blue

04:31.480 --> 04:35.810
and I'm kind of going with the three foot rule here.

04:35.850 --> 04:39.740
My wife sews and does alterations and embroidery.

04:39.750 --> 04:46.290
And one of the tests is if a piece of clothing will look good from three feet away.

04:46.440 --> 04:50.110
And that's kind of what I'm going for here the three foot rule.

04:50.130 --> 04:54.060
Now notice what happens here as I paint.

04:54.180 --> 04:56.400
I'm getting paint on this as well.

04:56.400 --> 05:02.910
And if you recall the reason why that is is because they're over lapping each other.

05:02.910 --> 05:06.040
Let me see if I can find where the armor is.

05:06.050 --> 05:10.000
I'm going to hover over this window and press control up arrow.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.840
Here it is right here.

05:11.910 --> 05:20.800
So as I'm painting it's laying paint down right here and the U-V maps of both of those objects are one

05:20.820 --> 05:25.820
on top of the other here and that's why I'm getting the paint happening at the same time there.

05:26.040 --> 05:30.530
So in press control up arrow to minimize that screen.

05:30.540 --> 05:31.110
All right.

05:31.110 --> 05:37.980
So there's that actually I'll work on this one since there's no overlap of the mesh.

05:37.980 --> 05:43.020
Let's take a look and see if we can find medium color in there or maybe a very bright one.

05:43.020 --> 05:45.130
Let's try that one.

05:45.210 --> 05:47.120
I'm going to select this one.

05:48.620 --> 05:51.090
I'm going to reduce the size of the brush again.

05:51.110 --> 05:58.290
Make it pretty small and this time I'm going to increase the spacing just a bit.

05:58.310 --> 06:07.220
Increase the jitter a hair and I just want to do these highlights on the top where the light source

06:07.220 --> 06:07.810
would be.

06:07.820 --> 06:12.740
Generally speaking the light source is rarely ever going to be coming out from the bottom.

06:12.740 --> 06:18.030
So I'm just going to try and work up here where the highlights would be

06:21.250 --> 06:26.560
and then also be probably a highlight right in here as well.

06:26.730 --> 06:33.550
Now maybe I should get a little more grime down here in the center so I'll go back to one of those darker

06:33.550 --> 06:35.920
colors like this.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.330
And maybe make that even a little darker.

06:40.410 --> 06:44.400
And come in here and kind of dirty that up on the inside.

06:46.350 --> 06:46.640
All right.

06:46.650 --> 06:49.930
We're beginning to get kind of a patina on that.

06:49.930 --> 06:51.830
That's looking pretty good.

06:51.840 --> 06:58.750
I'm going to start working on the same kind of colors appear on the shoulder armor.

06:59.280 --> 07:04.570
This is going to be a little bit different just because it's a larger surface area.

07:04.920 --> 07:10.320
But before I begin I think him to come down here and save this image in fact what I'll do is come over

07:10.320 --> 07:14.940
to the slots tab and just click Save all images.

07:14.940 --> 07:15.970
There we go.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.160
So for this let's choose our colors again.

07:19.200 --> 07:25.770
Once again I guess I can begin with a fairly dark color here and then I'll move through with the blue

07:25.860 --> 07:29.930
and the lighter color kind of do the same thing.

07:29.940 --> 07:38.960
So first of all I'm going to scatter a little bit more jitter a little bit more and let me open up the

07:39.380 --> 07:47.360
U-V editor here control up arrow and let me zoom out to see where that armor is.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.650
There it is.

07:48.680 --> 07:58.080
So I just want to have this in my window as I work so we've got some of that darker color laid down.

07:58.130 --> 08:02.970
Now let's come through and work on that little bit lighter color.

08:03.010 --> 08:03.910
This one here

08:14.820 --> 08:19.490
and let's work on another color here this lighter color.

08:21.970 --> 08:28.870
Maybe I'll reduce the spacing some and for this I'll actually reduce the brush size and I'll kind of

08:28.870 --> 08:37.080
come in right along some of these designs and maybe try and give us some highlights here.

08:37.240 --> 08:45.840
Let me try this maybe a little too much again again reduced the strength.

08:45.910 --> 08:47.510
Let's see how this works.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.770
Yeah something like that.

08:51.190 --> 08:53.510
Just a light touch here.

08:55.860 --> 08:56.960
Here we go.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.530
Now if I go back to this other color maybe I'll even go I've got a dark color up here.

09:01.530 --> 09:03.380
I'll try this one.

09:03.900 --> 09:11.130
And then if I come in here and right below that line that I just painted that paint kind of a darker

09:11.130 --> 09:11.940
line.

09:12.930 --> 09:15.130
To emphasize that edge

09:20.520 --> 09:23.970
something like that so you can see it here.

09:24.150 --> 09:32.370
I think maybe I will start working more on that highlighting the designs with a light color for the

09:32.370 --> 09:38.010
highlights and then a dark color beneath it to kind of help those pop.

09:38.340 --> 09:42.510
So that's the way I think I'll keep working on this shoulder armor.
