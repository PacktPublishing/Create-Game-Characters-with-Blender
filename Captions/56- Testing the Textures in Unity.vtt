00:00.330 --> 00:08.070
Well we've got the color map ready to go here what we need to do now is export out our low poly character

00:08.430 --> 00:16.860
so we can take it into a game engine and go back to the default view and I don't need texturing on right

00:16.860 --> 00:17.640
now.

00:17.970 --> 00:26.520
So here is the character that we're going to export what we need to do is export out the low poly character

00:26.520 --> 00:27.760
as well as the eyes.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.140
So I'll just select each one of these.

00:30.390 --> 00:35.380
The chefs select the R and the low poly character.

00:35.610 --> 00:39.280
We don't need the high poly character we don't need the lights.

00:39.420 --> 00:47.080
So now we can come over here to file and export and I'm going to export it as an FBI X..

00:47.320 --> 00:54.370
You can drag your blend files directly into unity and it will convert them to SBX the way it does it

00:54.370 --> 01:00.470
is it goes and finds the original program that the file was created in like blender.

01:00.550 --> 01:08.140
It opens it up in the background uses Blender's FDX converter to convert the file and then closes Blendr

01:08.140 --> 01:08.800
up.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.750
So if all that's going to happen we might as well just convert it ourselves here in Blender.

01:13.810 --> 01:16.100
So I'll choose FDX.

01:16.170 --> 01:20.050
Now I want to come over here and choose selected objects right here.

01:21.390 --> 01:32.500
And eyebrows up to actually create a folder called exports to that and I'll put it right in here.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.170
So this is.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.580
I'll call this game character export

01:39.450 --> 01:40.450
0 1.

01:40.650 --> 01:45.890
Yes let's do that and away it goes.

01:45.890 --> 01:50.800
So now what let's do is let's open up unity and bring all of our files in.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.620
Ok hearing unity.

01:52.660 --> 01:58.640
Let's go ahead and bring in our files here are our files right here.

01:58.720 --> 02:02.000
We've got our game character SBX.

02:02.140 --> 02:08.040
We've got our normal map are ambient occlusion map and our color map.

02:08.050 --> 02:09.810
So let's go ahead and drag these in.

02:09.810 --> 02:14.650
All we've got to do is take these files and drag them into the assets window here.

02:15.500 --> 02:22.520
So there are the materials that came with the character and here is the actual character.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.720
Let's bring in the other files as well.

02:24.710 --> 02:30.260
Let's bring in the normal map right here.

02:30.930 --> 02:37.660
Let's bring in the ambient occlusion and let's bring in the color map.

02:39.060 --> 02:40.090
And then we go.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.620
So now let's hook them all up.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.400
Oh and one more thing I need the eye texture as well.

02:46.410 --> 02:48.800
Let me go find that.

02:48.900 --> 02:49.300
All right.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.060
I have it here.

02:50.070 --> 02:53.060
I'm just going to paste it into this folder.

02:53.070 --> 02:56.620
This is the texture that we used earlier in Blender.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.730
So just drag that in as well.

02:59.730 --> 03:00.500
There we go.

03:00.660 --> 03:03.280
So now I think we have everything we need.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.660
I'll go back to unity and let's give this a try.

03:06.660 --> 03:10.770
So I'm going to take this character and just drag him in.

03:11.860 --> 03:17.040
And I'll come over here to the inspector and zeroed these out.

03:20.510 --> 03:23.920
So he's right in the center of the grid.

03:26.630 --> 03:28.100
There he is.

03:28.320 --> 03:36.120
Now we come over here and choose the low poly character you can see the base color Shater over here

03:36.120 --> 03:39.110
that came in from Blendr.

03:39.210 --> 03:43.650
This is now a standard Shater in unity.

03:43.650 --> 03:50.480
So this is where we'll put all of our texture maps the ambient occlusion map can go over here and the

03:50.480 --> 03:57.680
occlusions slot the normal map can go over here and the normal map slot.

03:57.930 --> 04:03.960
And then of course it says it needs to be marked as a normal map so we'll click fix now.

04:05.270 --> 04:06.320
And that helps.

04:06.590 --> 04:10.860
And then we take our color map and bring it over into the albedo slot.

04:11.810 --> 04:13.550
And then we go.

04:13.590 --> 04:20.600
So now we have our character now he's the light in the scene is kind of turned the wrong way let me

04:20.600 --> 04:23.960
select the directional light and I'm going to bring it up.

04:24.110 --> 04:29.090
And I'm also going to just rotate it in the scene so I like it.

04:29.100 --> 04:37.460
So it points more at the front of the character and where you go now we should be able to see him a

04:37.460 --> 04:38.940
little bit better.

04:39.020 --> 04:39.620
And there you go.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.020
Yeah he looks pretty good.

04:41.030 --> 04:45.380
You can see he's got the normal map information in there.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.420
We've got the color map.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.830
He doesn't look too bad.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.850
You can see the sculped information in here.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.550
Yeah look at that again character.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.100
Oh and let's also work on the ice here.

05:03.720 --> 05:13.450
If we select the eyes Here's one and bring in our eye texture into the albedo and we've got that good.

05:13.470 --> 05:15.130
OK.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.040
Now there he is.

05:17.040 --> 05:17.910
You can see

05:21.550 --> 05:25.050
we've got the eyes in there.

05:25.060 --> 05:26.380
The color map.

05:26.380 --> 05:29.150
The normal map the ambient occlusion.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.860
It doesn't look too bad.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.750
And there we go our game character.
