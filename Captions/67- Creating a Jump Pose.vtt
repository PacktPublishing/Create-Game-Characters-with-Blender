00:00.570 --> 00:04.580
In the last video I mentioned I thought I'd maybe try and clean up some of these curves.

00:04.590 --> 00:12.870
And I think these types of little blips in the curve is something that I don't want.

00:13.050 --> 00:21.690
Oftentimes as I said when you see this kind of abrupt reversal in a curve in the graph editor it can

00:21.690 --> 00:23.760
signal that there's probably a problem.

00:23.790 --> 00:29.000
I mean unless the animation is specifically made to do that.

00:29.010 --> 00:30.890
But this really isn't so.

00:30.900 --> 00:37.860
And this one I feel like I'm not sure if it's reversing the movement here in the y axis I guess it is

00:37.860 --> 00:39.570
this is the Y-axis right.

00:39.570 --> 00:47.280
This is our Y location and it does look like it's reversing it slightly in the y axis and I don't think

00:47.280 --> 00:48.060
we want to do that.

00:48.060 --> 00:51.070
I don't think we want to continue that curve on.

00:51.140 --> 00:52.750
So let's take a look at this.

00:52.770 --> 00:59.580
Usually what I find is that I can just delete these and it works pretty well.

00:59.640 --> 01:00.790
So let's try this.

01:00.810 --> 01:07.620
I'm going to hit the x key and delete the key frame here and that gives me a little bit more of a curve

01:07.650 --> 01:07.890
there.

01:07.890 --> 01:14.850
Now let's take a look at what's happening here it's moving back in the y and it continues to move back

01:15.030 --> 01:20.510
so that the leg breaks here and we don't want that.

01:20.520 --> 01:25.590
But I also don't want to move this back toward the front of the character to try and fix that because

01:25.590 --> 01:27.600
that will just add another keyframe.

01:27.660 --> 01:33.630
So we should probably think about dealing with the torso.

01:33.630 --> 01:38.360
So let's take a look at what's happening here with the torso in these curves.

01:38.370 --> 01:43.530
So here we are at frame 5 and this is really this is the up position.

01:43.560 --> 01:48.560
So we want our character to be up at its highest point at this point in time.

01:48.690 --> 01:56.450
But does it need to be this high so let's see if we can move this down just a hair g.

01:56.460 --> 02:03.580
And Z and just move them down just a little bit and then click and that moves this keyframe down a hair.

02:03.930 --> 02:08.620
Now will we need to do that also at frame 11.

02:09.150 --> 02:10.460
Let's take a look there.

02:12.670 --> 02:16.350
Here's our passing poset frame 11.

02:16.450 --> 02:21.270
Let's take a look at the right foot come up here.

02:21.290 --> 02:24.320
Here's our problem keyframe.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.120
Let's delete that that.

02:27.130 --> 02:28.380
Yes pushes it back.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.430
So it's a little broken there.

02:31.780 --> 02:37.220
So we could go back and take a look at that keyframe for the torso again.

02:37.390 --> 02:42.270
I still need to move this down a hair g and Z and move it down a bit.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.620
So the leg doesn't break.

02:46.590 --> 02:54.430
Let's take a look let's go back to the graph for the foot and take a look at what happened here.

02:54.450 --> 02:58.740
We've also got this key frame here do we need that.

02:58.840 --> 03:03.640
Can we have this curve go smoothly from one to the other without this keyframe.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.300
I'm not sure.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.060
Let's take a look.

03:05.080 --> 03:14.250
Let's delete it and then we could actually hit V and free that handle and use that handle to give us

03:14.250 --> 03:16.840
a curve much like we had before.

03:18.790 --> 03:21.310
Like that that's possible.

03:21.340 --> 03:22.560
We could try that.

03:22.630 --> 03:28.070
Let's go back to frame five and I'll choose the left foot.

03:28.210 --> 03:35.560
And here we are the same type of keyframe I could delete this hit V for this keyframe to free the handle

03:35.890 --> 03:38.060
and use the handle to create the curve.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.790
So it's more smooth.

03:40.890 --> 03:42.820
That's a possibility too.

03:42.840 --> 03:49.170
So it's one of those things where you need to go through I think and try and smooth out your curves

03:49.590 --> 03:55.490
usually by deleting key frames when we go through and see what else we have here.

03:55.740 --> 03:56.670
This one down here.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.720
Let's take a look at this.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.170
What is this for.

03:59.660 --> 04:02.890
And let's delete this keyframe and see what happens.

04:02.950 --> 04:04.230
Oh this is the rotation.

04:04.230 --> 04:05.430
This isn't the movement.

04:05.430 --> 04:06.980
This is the rotation.

04:07.230 --> 04:08.130
So that's fine.

04:08.130 --> 04:09.960
We can get rid of that rotation.

04:09.960 --> 04:14.050
It doesn't need to flop or rotate back and forth there.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.720
That's fine.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.600
Let's go ahead and do that.

04:17.640 --> 04:18.960
What else can we find here.

04:18.960 --> 04:21.160
This one here what does this do.

04:21.180 --> 04:23.420
This is also a rotation.

04:23.880 --> 04:28.670
Let's see what happens when we delete this guy.

04:28.690 --> 04:28.990
All right.

04:28.990 --> 04:33.540
Now let's take a look at this OK.

04:33.670 --> 04:38.560
That was the rotation back and forth of that foot.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.120
So we really don't need that.

04:41.410 --> 04:45.190
That's just going to add to the floppy ness there of the feet.

04:45.430 --> 04:50.980
Let's take a look at this foot and see if there's a problem or anything we can do in terms of rotation

04:50.980 --> 04:51.970
here as well.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.950
What do you see here.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.190
See any problems.

05:02.520 --> 05:08.050
Not looking too bad here there's little blips here what is this.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.990
Let's move our cursor to that point.

05:11.080 --> 05:17.820
Is that that's a rotation we could probably do without these two frames.

05:17.830 --> 05:22.130
We really don't need the rotation of that.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.000
Well let's see.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.280
I'm just going to delete the two and see what happens.

05:29.180 --> 05:31.500
That's OK I can live without that.

05:32.970 --> 05:36.270
What else might cause us a little bit of a glitch here.

05:36.780 --> 05:38.620
It's actually not looking too bad.

05:38.880 --> 05:43.170
So I think I'm OK with this.

05:43.170 --> 05:49.840
Let's take a look at the run cycle and just let it play and see and see what we can see here.

05:49.860 --> 05:55.160
I'm just going to hit play and let's let it run.

05:59.430 --> 06:07.410
I'm also going to reduce the frame range back down to 12 because as we said our extra key frame at frame

06:07.410 --> 06:11.250
13 is really there just to allow it to repeat smoothly.

06:11.250 --> 06:14.980
So we don't need that as part of the actual run cycle.

06:17.170 --> 06:23.170
I think there's more that we could do with the arms and a little bit of follow through with the hammer

06:23.170 --> 06:24.590
and the shield.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.820
But for right now I think I'm pretty good with this.

06:27.820 --> 06:35.290
I think I'm ready to move on to the next thing and the next thing is the jump animation and I'm not

06:35.290 --> 06:41.860
really going to do an animation per se I'm just going to do still pose that we can use just have him

06:41.920 --> 06:44.880
have a pose for when he jumps.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.870
Just kind of a dynamic pose when he lifts off the ground.

06:48.880 --> 06:53.120
He's in that pose and when he hits the ground he comes out of that pose and that's it.

06:53.140 --> 06:57.310
So it'll just be a one pose jump animation I guess.

06:57.370 --> 07:00.250
So for this we could really put it anywhere.

07:00.550 --> 07:10.120
Right now we've got our run animation here from 1 to 12 and we've got our idle animation going Clear

07:10.120 --> 07:18.940
out to frame 81 so we could set up our jump shows out here at frame 100 I guess.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.300
Let's just do that.

07:20.710 --> 07:25.360
So I'm going to come out here and select everything with the A key so I can see the key frames down

07:25.360 --> 07:35.930
here in the timeline and I'll come out here to frame 100 and make my start 95 and I'll make my end.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.850
105.

07:37.930 --> 07:38.870
Why not.

07:39.330 --> 07:44.950
And I'll hit the home key on the keyboard to zoom in to that frame range.

07:44.950 --> 07:52.630
So here we are also what I want to do I think is bring that default pose back out here.

07:52.630 --> 07:54.970
So we begin with the default pose.

07:55.030 --> 08:03.340
I'm going to come in here and go to this frame Oh let's go to frame zero here and select all of those

08:03.340 --> 08:05.790
key frames all the way down.

08:06.830 --> 08:10.170
And I'm just going to duplicate those and move those out to frame 100.

08:10.170 --> 08:19.170
So I'm going to move the cursor out to 100 and then I'll just come back and press shift D and move that

08:19.170 --> 08:21.880
entire thing out to frame 100.

08:22.140 --> 08:23.750
Oh I don't need it to be at 100.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.750
Move it to 95 here.

08:26.750 --> 08:27.650
Now we go.

08:27.840 --> 08:36.580
Now let's take a look at how we can arrange him to make him kind of look cool as he jumps.

08:36.960 --> 08:43.560
Now one thing to realize is that this center torso control shouldn't go up or down even though this

08:43.560 --> 08:44.810
is a jump pose.

08:44.820 --> 08:48.920
We're not going to move the character up or down at all.

08:48.960 --> 08:55.800
We're just going to change the position of the legs the arms and the head will create the lift up off

08:55.800 --> 09:05.840
the ground in the game engine through coding so we just want to change the pose and not the position.

09:06.050 --> 09:07.520
So let's see what we can do here.

09:07.520 --> 09:13.370
I think first of all I'm going to work on the feet and get them in a position that's kind of what I

09:13.370 --> 09:14.460
want here.

09:14.660 --> 09:23.030
Let me go to this side view and I think I want one foot up and the other down and kind of a toe pointed.

09:23.030 --> 09:29.870
So I'm just going to take this foot and move it up a bit maybe like that and maybe roll that down a

09:29.870 --> 09:37.440
bit like that I think I should probably turn on the manipulators here and go to global for now and I'm

09:37.440 --> 09:41.390
going to lift that straight up like that maybe.

09:41.800 --> 09:46.770
And for this I can maybe rotate this down and move this up a bit.

09:47.710 --> 09:54.620
So it is kind of like that maybe as he jumps he looks down a bit because he's looking down to where

09:54.620 --> 09:59.990
he's going to land and maybe when he jumps he kind of lifts his arms up.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.700
Let's see what we can do with that.

10:01.700 --> 10:12.690
So maybe I'll bring this in maybe rotate this a bit maybe bring it up a bit let's see what we can do

10:12.690 --> 10:13.190
here.

10:16.590 --> 10:20.350
Rotate that something like that.

10:20.360 --> 10:25.010
I think it needs a little more tweaking but you know something like this where the arms go up and they're

10:25.010 --> 10:30.150
kind of up as he comes down something like this.

10:32.810 --> 10:37.670
All right so there's that arm let's say let's see what we can do with the other arm.

10:37.790 --> 10:40.480
I kind of do the same thing and move it up.

10:40.490 --> 10:44.110
I don't think it will be as much this time.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.860
I don't think I think maybe something like that doesn't look too bad.

10:50.320 --> 10:53.170
Have been hanging onto the shield like this

10:57.320 --> 11:00.530
if we can lift the shoulders up a bit let's try that.

11:04.510 --> 11:08.620
All right so I think I'm going to go with something like this.

11:08.710 --> 11:17.380
This will just give us a pose to use as he lifts off the ground and it's nothing special here at all.

11:17.380 --> 11:24.370
I just want to have something for us that we can use when we take this into unity and begin setting

11:24.370 --> 11:26.010
up the character controller.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.020
All right well let's go with that.

11:28.030 --> 11:36.300
We've now have our poses or our animation cycles for our idol our jump and our run.

11:36.490 --> 11:42.940
And these are of course the very basic animations for a game character there can be a lot more.

11:43.150 --> 11:47.780
But to keep things pretty straightforward I think I'm just going to go with these three animations.

11:47.890 --> 11:54.850
And these are what will then take into unity create the animation clips in unity and then set up our

11:54.850 --> 12:00.790
character controller so that we can actually control the character in game using keyboard controls.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.830
So in the next video we'll start working on that.

12:03.910 --> 12:05.940
So stay tuned and I'll see you then.
