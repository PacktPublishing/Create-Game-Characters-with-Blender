WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:07.900
In the last video we saw that we were having some problems with the binder around the chin also around

00:07.910 --> 00:09.630
the belt buckle.

00:09.950 --> 00:13.540
Let's take a look at seeing if we can fix those.

00:13.550 --> 00:21.590
I'm going to come up here to the head control and we just hit our twice and as we move it around it

00:21.590 --> 00:22.820
doesn't look too bad.

00:22.820 --> 00:25.290
Here you can kind of see some stretching.

00:25.550 --> 00:33.410
But if we choose the neck you can see we've got quite a bit of stretching there and that's not going

00:33.410 --> 00:34.090
to work.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.290
So let's see if we can work on that.

00:37.340 --> 00:42.860
The first thing I'll do is go ahead and select the character and I'm going to come over here to the

00:42.860 --> 00:46.370
object mode menu and choose wait paint.

00:46.370 --> 00:53.570
And that should allow us to see the weights on the character and you can see this one down here is currently

00:53.570 --> 00:54.560
selected.

00:54.590 --> 00:58.900
We've got thigh one on the right.

00:58.970 --> 01:03.510
If I scroll up and see if we can find Here's the head right here.

01:03.530 --> 01:09.380
So this is what the influence of the head looks like.

01:09.380 --> 01:12.510
Let me see if I can make this menu a little bit bigger.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.220
Scroll that up.

01:15.220 --> 01:17.670
I mean it's going to grab this and drag it down.

01:19.210 --> 01:22.520
Just so we have a better list of our vertex groups.

01:22.610 --> 01:30.620
So for each vertex group here we have a certain amount of weight or influence on the vertices of the

01:30.620 --> 01:31.480
character.

01:31.670 --> 01:37.730
The red color means that it's really influenced or almost all influenced by that bone.

01:37.790 --> 01:42.090
And then as you move to green and blue it gets less and less.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.920
So if we tap into edit mode here I'm going to hit the tab key.

01:45.920 --> 01:55.760
Go into edit mode and I'm going to de-select everything here and with this this up with this head Virtex

01:55.800 --> 02:02.530
a group selected I can click select to see what vertices are a part of that group.

02:02.660 --> 02:06.110
So I'll hit select and there they are.

02:06.260 --> 02:12.710
So we can see that there's quite a few vertices being influenced by the head bone that are actually

02:12.950 --> 02:16.350
down here into the back and onto this piece of armor.

02:16.490 --> 02:19.240
And I don't know that we want that.

02:19.280 --> 02:25.430
In addition if we take a look at the at the neck Let me scroll all the way down here I think the neck

02:25.460 --> 02:28.880
is right here.

02:28.930 --> 02:36.820
I'll hit the aikido de-select select the neck vertex group and choose select and you can see that the

02:36.820 --> 02:44.940
neck is influence way down here into the back and more onto the armor and way up here into the head.

02:44.950 --> 02:52.530
And that's why it's influencing that chin because we have so much influence up into the head.

02:52.960 --> 03:00.880
So what let's do is I'm going to go to the side view and the orthographic view here and I'll go ahead

03:00.880 --> 03:08.230
and hit the Z key for wireframe and what we need to do is remove the influence of all these extras and

03:08.230 --> 03:11.650
just select what we want for the head and the neck.

03:11.650 --> 03:17.860
So let me begin with the head first I'll go up here to the head and I'll hit the aikido de-select I'll

03:17.860 --> 03:26.020
hit Selecta over here to see that vertex group I'll come down here and click Remove to remove all those

03:26.020 --> 03:29.770
vertices out of that vertex group.

03:29.780 --> 03:36.200
Now I'm going to select just what I want to be in there so I'll hit the C key to enable the circle select

03:36.200 --> 03:36.830
tool.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.740
And I'm just going to click and drag all of these words CS in here.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.930
So we only have the head vertices selected.

03:44.930 --> 03:51.600
And now with the head vertex group still selected I'll click assign OK.

03:51.600 --> 04:00.240
So now if we tab back out of edit mode and look at the White paint you can see that that influence is

04:00.240 --> 04:04.220
completely and totally 100 percent on the head.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.120
That's what we want.

04:06.120 --> 04:15.920
So let's do that again for the neck we're when I come down here to the neck vertex group and I'll click

04:15.920 --> 04:22.090
select and I'll remove all of these move.

04:22.800 --> 04:28.110
Now I'm just going to select the vertices that we want so I'll press alt and click one of these edges

04:28.140 --> 04:33.630
and then I want to press control and the plus key and expand this selection.

04:33.630 --> 04:36.410
So it's just the neck.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.560
And here we go.

04:37.560 --> 04:44.250
Umunna tab back into here and I'll choose face mode.

04:44.560 --> 04:52.090
And I just want to de-selected these faces I don't want it to influence the armer at all here.

04:52.090 --> 04:58.720
All right there we go if I go back to Virtex mode you can see the vertices that are affected and then

04:58.720 --> 05:01.620
I'll click assign.

05:01.710 --> 05:02.050
All right.

05:02.050 --> 05:08.840
And now if we go back to white paint mode you can see it's influencing only on the neck.

05:08.860 --> 05:14.750
There's a little bit of overlap over here on the armor Let's see if that's going to be a problem.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.850
So I'll go back to object mode.

05:17.860 --> 05:30.130
I'll select this control and let's test it out that it's pulling a bit on that arm or I'd like it to

05:30.360 --> 05:32.880
to not do that.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.090
So let me go back to wait paint mode.

05:37.630 --> 05:41.490
And let's go ahead and remove the vertices along there.

05:41.490 --> 05:49.080
Hit the aikido de-select those and I'm just going to select these points right along here and let's

05:49.080 --> 05:50.540
see how this works.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.020
Something like that.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.330
And then I'll hit remove.

05:55.420 --> 05:55.930
All right.

05:55.950 --> 06:02.730
Now let's go back to object mode like that control and let's move it around a bit.

06:02.880 --> 06:10.140
Yes so now we get not much movement out of that arm or looks like there's still a little bit going on

06:10.140 --> 06:11.420
but not too bad.

06:13.170 --> 06:15.310
Yeah I think we're OK there.

06:15.630 --> 06:21.250
And let's test the head the head as well seems to move OK.

06:21.420 --> 06:23.390
And the jaw seems to be OK.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.540
But take a look at the eyes.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.240
Wow.

06:29.370 --> 06:31.200
Let's work on the eyes now.

06:32.610 --> 06:41.580
So I'm going to go ahead and go back to object mode and and select that I right here select one of those

06:41.580 --> 06:49.950
eyes and I want to come up to the head bone and I want to make sure that it's 100 percent being influenced

06:49.950 --> 06:51.300
by the head bone.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.450
So I'll tab and edit mode.

06:53.610 --> 06:59.560
The key select the head vertex group and click assign.

06:59.570 --> 07:09.310
Now I want to come back down to the neck vertex group and hit remove to make sure it isn't influenced

07:09.310 --> 07:10.260
by that.

07:10.600 --> 07:18.850
So let's see now what happens when we go to pose mode and move the neck around.

07:19.190 --> 07:19.480
Right.

07:19.520 --> 07:23.050
That one eye's pretty well locked in place.

07:23.060 --> 07:26.100
But now we need to do that for the right eye.

07:26.600 --> 07:32.990
So select that I tab into edit mode select all the vertices.

07:32.990 --> 07:40.280
Remove it from the neck and assign it to the head.

07:40.290 --> 07:41.930
Now as we've been doing this.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.980
Notice that the weight here has been at one has been at 100 percent.

07:46.980 --> 07:54.510
Now we can adjust the weight to whatever value we want but for right now I think 100 percent is what

07:54.510 --> 07:57.800
we need for these particular pieces.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.490
All right.

07:58.800 --> 08:08.520
So if I select that neck hit the Arki looking pretty good about the head yeah.

08:08.760 --> 08:09.600
OK.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.910
I think we got it.

08:11.910 --> 08:16.110
So the weight once again on these items looks like

08:19.070 --> 08:20.330
there's the neck

08:24.060 --> 08:26.810
and there's the head.

08:27.090 --> 08:33.490
So let's take a look at these other parts of the body like this belt buckle and the torso.

08:33.510 --> 08:40.230
So what let's do is let's see what is influencing this particular buckle.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.320
So to do that I'll go back and select the character.

08:43.320 --> 08:49.980
Hit the tab key and I'm going to go ahead and go into wireframe and front view and orthographic view

08:49.980 --> 08:50.780
here.

08:50.850 --> 08:57.010
Now what we want to do is try and find the vertex groups that are affecting this particular belt buckles.

08:57.010 --> 09:04.050
So I'm going to scroll all the way down here and let's first look at the hips right here and I'll click

09:04.050 --> 09:05.610
select.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.750
And here is what's being influenced by the hips.

09:08.750 --> 09:16.110
Now if we tumble around we see that that particular buckle really isn't being affected by that at all.

09:16.190 --> 09:21.700
But I'm thinking it needs to be I'm thinking this really should be held in place by the hips.

09:21.890 --> 09:28.470
So what let's do is let's go ahead and select this object I'm going to hover over it.

09:28.550 --> 09:35.000
Press the key hover over here and press the L key as well and select all of that and I'm going to go

09:35.000 --> 09:43.980
ahead and assign these vertices to the hips vertex group so I'll just click a assign and we go.

09:43.980 --> 09:47.190
So now we know it's assigned to where we needed to be.

09:47.310 --> 09:53.550
But is it still being influenced by other vertex groups that we don't want it to be influenced by.

09:53.550 --> 09:57.540
So let's take a look at the spine here.

09:58.700 --> 10:05.750
I'll hit the select button and that's being influenced that's not being influenced by that.

10:05.960 --> 10:06.770
OK.

10:07.810 --> 10:11.890
So that's and in fact the spine bone that's a little too much.

10:11.890 --> 10:17.920
We're going to need to take out some of this and maybe even take out some of that up here.

10:18.370 --> 10:22.060
So OK we've taken a look at the hips and the spine.

10:22.060 --> 10:24.390
Let's look at the chest here.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.570
Click select.

10:27.130 --> 10:28.040
There it is.

10:28.270 --> 10:36.970
So you can see that even though the chest bone is way up here it's influencing these vertices here.

10:36.970 --> 10:46.390
So what let's do is let's go ahead and select that again hit L and L and let's remove it from this vertex

10:46.390 --> 10:49.070
groups or click Remove.

10:49.180 --> 10:52.460
And now let's give this a try.

10:52.510 --> 10:57.830
I go back to object mode click on this guy here and now let's see what happens.

10:58.880 --> 11:03.830
Better now it's not being influenced by any of those.

11:03.890 --> 11:06.770
It should be however influenced by this.

11:06.770 --> 11:08.210
That's right.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.870
So that's correct.

11:09.890 --> 11:14.330
However we've got more influence happening on the belt.

11:14.330 --> 11:17.120
So just quickly let's go ahead and take care of that.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.840
Let's test the chest vertex group here.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.050
I'll select that.

11:22.370 --> 11:22.760
OK.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.740
That looks pretty good.

11:24.760 --> 11:32.690
Let's select the spine hit the achy to de-select and select that that I think is our problem.

11:32.810 --> 11:40.940
We need to de-select all of these down here I don't think we want all of this area being affected by

11:40.940 --> 11:42.270
the spine.

11:42.320 --> 11:48.890
So what let's do is just once again hover over the belt hit the L key to select that and now want to

11:48.890 --> 11:53.420
remove that from this vertex groups or click Remove.

11:53.750 --> 12:00.620
And now if we go back to object mode hit that spine bone and rotate it.

12:00.620 --> 12:04.240
Now we're getting better deformation there now.

12:04.250 --> 12:09.620
We've still got more to do of course because we've got to remove all of this off of that as well.

12:09.620 --> 12:12.650
But you can see the basic process.

12:12.650 --> 12:17.810
So what I will do is go through and find specific parts of the character that I think are deforming

12:17.840 --> 12:25.520
a little oddly and I'll go through the process of removing the problem areas from Virtex grooves that

12:25.520 --> 12:33.230
should not be influencing it and making sure that it's being fully influenced by the bones that do need

12:33.230 --> 12:35.040
to influence it.

12:35.060 --> 12:40.760
There's one more thing I'd like to do before we're done with the rigging process and that's to turn

12:40.760 --> 12:42.630
off the stretchy.

12:42.680 --> 12:48.570
Right now if I choose one of the I.K. handles and move it and you can stretch the arms and the legs.

12:48.830 --> 12:53.330
And that's really cool and everything but I don't think it's going to work with the way I want to animate

12:53.330 --> 12:54.670
it.

12:54.740 --> 13:01.100
I don't want to be accidentally stretching the arms and legs as I animate the character so I'm going

13:01.100 --> 13:07.730
to press the end key and with that I.K. handle selected I'm going to scroll all the way down here and

13:07.730 --> 13:12.530
this auto stretch I.K. I can take this all the way down to zero.

13:12.710 --> 13:19.310
And now if I hit G and move around you can see the arm won't stretch beyond where it's supposed to the

13:19.310 --> 13:24.490
I.K. handle will move out but the arm won't stretch.

13:24.590 --> 13:32.150
So I just want to go through and do that for all of the I.K. handles on both the arms and the legs.

13:33.670 --> 13:35.570
And that should take care of that.

13:39.330 --> 13:40.180
There we go.

13:40.290 --> 13:46.950
All right well I think we're about ready to begin animating I'm going to go through and do a little

13:46.950 --> 13:52.630
more tweaks and make sure that all of the weights are the way we need them.

13:52.770 --> 13:58.380
But after that I think we're pretty much ready to begin animating and I think we're just going to do

13:58.390 --> 14:03.550
the basic animation cycles for a video game character.

14:03.660 --> 14:14.100
The idle the run the jump and I have a war hammer and I might make a shield for this guy we'll see.

14:14.130 --> 14:18.960
I'd like to have him look like the original drawing that we began with.

14:19.110 --> 14:23.270
So maybe I'll bring those into and we'll parent those to his hands.
