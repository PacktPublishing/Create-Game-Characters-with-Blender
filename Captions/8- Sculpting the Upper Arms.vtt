00:00.670 --> 00:07.990
Well today let's work a little bit more on the upper part of the body here the shoulders the upper arms

00:07.990 --> 00:09.490
that kind of thing.

00:10.090 --> 00:16.760
I'll switch over to sculpt mode and we can see what we've done so far here.

00:16.780 --> 00:21.940
I've got the deltoids and scapula roughed in.

00:21.940 --> 00:26.800
Let's now work on the traps here at the back of the head.

00:26.800 --> 00:34.660
That kind of triangle that happens from the back of the head to the top of the shoulders and over to

00:35.020 --> 00:36.800
the spine.

00:36.850 --> 00:44.480
So what I'll do is all just mask out that area invert the mask and then sculpt again in there.

00:44.560 --> 00:55.270
So I'll switch over to the mask brush and let's zoom in and see if we can mask this area out so that

00:55.270 --> 00:57.360
we can begin sculpting in here.

00:57.510 --> 01:04.480
When I press the F key and reduce the size of the brush a bit I've got the strength of the mask at 100

01:04.480 --> 01:11.770
for now and see how that works and what I want to do is just begin drawing the mask out.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.520
Right down into here.

01:16.140 --> 01:25.930
And may be coming around down here about like this something like this

01:30.140 --> 01:31.510
and then fill it in here

01:34.740 --> 01:37.780
I think that's about right.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.810
I might want to give it a little bit more in here.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.310
There we go.

01:44.310 --> 01:50.800
Now what I'll do is invert the mask I can come down here to hide and invert mask.

01:50.820 --> 02:01.020
And now everything else is masked out and I'll come to the clay strips brush just my brush a bit maybe

02:01.020 --> 02:08.350
change the strength maybe reduce it just a little bit at the beginning here see how I'm doing.

02:09.060 --> 02:14.930
And then come in here and begin sculpting in here to bring this area out of bed.

02:18.180 --> 02:25.350
Kind of bulk it up a bit.

02:25.680 --> 02:26.340
All right.

02:26.340 --> 02:34.690
So now I can work on this neck muscle that comes from kind of the back of the skull and kind of does

02:34.830 --> 02:41.400
another S-curve around the neck down here to the front of the clavicle.

02:41.610 --> 02:44.320
So I will clear the mask here.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.260
And then let's start drawing out.

02:48.290 --> 02:52.460
Another one for that particular muscle.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.030
So I'll reduce my brush a bit.

02:56.030 --> 03:05.520
Zoom in and it usually comes from kind of behind the ear here something like this.

03:07.350 --> 03:15.870
And down along that muscle and forward to the front of the clavicle like that.

03:16.340 --> 03:24.280
I don't want it so high here I can press control and stroke and erase the mask here.

03:24.290 --> 03:26.280
I like that.

03:26.300 --> 03:32.930
All right so when the press control and invert the mask come back over to my clay strips brush with

03:32.930 --> 03:44.200
my three key and then I'll start sculpting in here try and bring this out a bit here we go.

03:44.470 --> 03:48.480
So now we've got that coming around the neck.

03:48.570 --> 03:52.520
I feel like I can build up the trap is Zoids a little bit more here.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.320
So maybe I'll work on that as well.

03:55.630 --> 03:59.280
So I'll hit all at him to clear the mask.

03:59.290 --> 04:04.010
And now I'm going to come back in here and work on the traps just a little bit more.

04:10.940 --> 04:13.380
And I'm also going to cut in just a bit.

04:13.470 --> 04:23.950
And to hear this little dip that happens behind the clavicle and I'm just pressing control to get to

04:23.950 --> 04:31.210
kind of cut in there just a little bit something like that.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.830
I'm a smooth these back just a little bit.

04:35.060 --> 04:38.060
Not a lot but just a little.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.190
Check out the strength of my smooth brush here.

04:41.540 --> 04:46.040
And then press shift and smooth back just a little bit.

04:46.460 --> 04:51.540
Well we've got some sculped information down for the trip there.

04:51.890 --> 05:00.370
The clavicle the deltoids Let's start working on the upper arm here the biceps and triceps.

05:00.380 --> 05:07.880
So once again what I'm going to do is draw in a mask for the bicep that I that I can then use to sculpt

05:07.880 --> 05:08.910
with.

05:08.960 --> 05:16.720
So I'll come back here to the mask tool and for this it's going to insert right in here.

05:16.850 --> 05:23.230
In a kind of a teardrop right into the bottom of the deltoid here.

05:23.570 --> 05:27.020
So I want to go ahead and try and mask this out.

05:27.020 --> 05:29.250
I'll draw it right in here.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.250
Kind of a curve here

05:37.240 --> 05:46.150
pouring it down around in here and it's going to insert down into an in-between the major muscles of

05:46.150 --> 05:47.830
the forearm.

05:47.860 --> 05:52.130
So let me see probably in here

05:55.980 --> 05:57.320
something like that.

06:01.490 --> 06:10.280
All right so now press control and come back to the clay strips brush with the three key and start doing

06:10.280 --> 06:21.290
just a little sculpting here to bring out that form.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.200
All right.

06:22.370 --> 06:24.230
Let's work with that.

06:24.230 --> 06:26.810
I don't want to bring it out too far right now.

06:28.260 --> 06:35.880
Now let's go to the back of the arm and draw out the triceps the triceps are going to be a similar kind

06:35.880 --> 06:45.990
of shape so I'll clear the mask with Allt em and then let's come around here and try and draw that one

06:45.990 --> 06:46.910
out as well.

06:50.450 --> 06:55.630
I'm going to have this one insert pretty far up underneath the deltoids here.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.450
I'll have them kind of meet

07:04.220 --> 07:10.900
right on the side of the arm here just almost and then connect up right there.

07:11.500 --> 07:18.980
Fill these in and I'm going to use the Control key to cut out a place for the elbow here.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.370
So let's invert the mask with control.

07:23.370 --> 07:30.040
I go back to our clay strips and let's start sculpting in here.

07:34.810 --> 07:40.210
Now the last bit of the upper arm here that I want to deal with is just this little muscle right in

07:40.210 --> 07:41.890
between those two.

07:41.980 --> 07:44.390
I believe that's called the Iraqi palace.

07:44.680 --> 07:52.790
But let's clear the mask with all to him and then I'm going to mask it off.

07:54.610 --> 07:55.640
Right in here

07:59.060 --> 08:04.310
just a little bit right in there I don't want to do too much because there's going to be that forearm

08:04.400 --> 08:09.860
muscle that comes through here so I'll just mask this off.

08:10.060 --> 08:13.000
I'll invert the mask with control eye.

08:13.240 --> 08:21.170
And I just want to do a little bit in here to bulk that out slightly naff.

08:21.220 --> 08:22.160
I clear that

08:25.500 --> 08:30.440
I may be able to kind of connect these two a little bit like this.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.930
There we go.

08:32.850 --> 08:39.550
So it kind of fits down in between the bicep and tricep.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.030
All right.

08:40.040 --> 08:47.060
So we're doing pretty well here we've got some good forms for the upper arms and the upper part of the

08:47.060 --> 08:48.370
torso.

08:48.740 --> 08:55.160
I think in the next video we're probably work on the lower arms here and begin thinking about the rest

08:55.160 --> 08:55.980
of the torso.
