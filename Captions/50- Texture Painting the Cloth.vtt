WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:06.220
Now that we have our interface set up for texture painting the cloth here.

00:06.380 --> 00:08.820
Let's go ahead and work on this see what we can do.

00:09.170 --> 00:17.420
I've got these images up to sample colors but I think I'd also like to use this image as a stencil actually

00:17.480 --> 00:21.210
lay that texture down on this cloth.

00:21.590 --> 00:29.240
I'm going to scroll down here and instead of the noise brush let's add a new texture to our brush and

00:29.270 --> 00:35.110
maybe we could call this what we call this cloth cloth brush.

00:35.570 --> 00:41.590
And over here let's change or find an image for that.

00:41.590 --> 00:42.650
Let's find that image.

00:42.650 --> 00:47.620
So here's the material here's the textures of the material.

00:47.630 --> 00:51.670
And here is the brush texture or cloth brush.

00:51.680 --> 00:59.110
Let's go ahead and keep this as image or movie and let's come down here and click on Open.

00:59.240 --> 01:04.040
And now I need to find my images and reference images.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.650
And let's see which one it is.

01:06.650 --> 01:18.220
Let's go with this cloth one and we go so now we have this image loaded up as a texture in our brush.

01:18.220 --> 01:25.450
Now what we need to do is change this brush mapping from random to stencil.

01:25.510 --> 01:34.130
I'll also come down here and turn the jitter down and turn the spacing down a bit as well and you can

01:34.130 --> 01:39.490
see when I hover over the 3D view I get this preview of the texture.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.030
You can see it here.

01:41.330 --> 01:46.640
Now I can move this around by using the right mouse button.

01:46.640 --> 01:54.440
So if I click the right mouse button and drag I can move it around and if I press the shift button and

01:54.440 --> 01:57.910
the right mouse button and click and drag I can zoom in and out.

01:58.070 --> 02:03.090
I can also rotate it with the Control key and the right mouse button as well.

02:03.560 --> 02:12.360
So then with the normal mouse buttons I can move my character around here like so so let's try this.

02:12.360 --> 02:18.330
Let's see if we can get the texture on this front panel here.

02:18.550 --> 02:21.330
Let's adjust our color here.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.040
We don't want this Baloo.

02:23.290 --> 02:29.860
Let me come over here to this image hold the key down and let me sample and nice fairly light brownish

02:29.860 --> 02:32.340
color here if I can find one.

02:32.470 --> 02:35.580
Maybe I'll come up here and try this.

02:35.930 --> 02:36.970
Something like that.

02:36.970 --> 02:38.360
There we go.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.640
I can get rid of this.

02:39.640 --> 02:40.660
I don't want that.

02:41.230 --> 02:43.670
And maybe I'll even make this a little bit brighter.

02:44.770 --> 02:45.520
Yeah let's try this.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.420
I'm going to hit the F key and increase the size of the brush.

02:49.630 --> 02:56.010
I want to come down here and turn on face masking because I only want to work on this front panel so

02:56.010 --> 03:02.830
I'll turn on face masking hit the A key to make sure everything's de-selected all hover over this and

03:02.830 --> 03:04.720
press the L key.

03:04.810 --> 03:10.190
And now if we click and drag on here let's see what happens.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.570
You can barely see I mean you zoom in here that that texture is being laid down on that and I think

03:18.570 --> 03:22.610
I want it to be a little bit more than that little bit better.

03:22.620 --> 03:30.450
Let's try and bring our brush color down a bit and maybe I'll increase the strength of hair.

03:30.450 --> 03:31.470
Let's try again.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.140
See how this works.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.640
It's a little bit better.

03:38.660 --> 03:39.380
Yeah.

03:39.890 --> 03:43.770
We're getting a little bit more of that texture on there.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.800
But still not enough to undo.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.050
I think I want that color to be a little bit lighter.

03:50.270 --> 03:52.190
Let me try this.

03:52.880 --> 04:03.240
Something like this I'm actually going to increase the strength a little bit more and let's try this.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.430
Now we're getting some of that color down.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.370
That's looking a little better.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.580
Kind of like that.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.810
Let me turn off the stencil real quick.

04:13.810 --> 04:17.460
I'll change that back to the plane and let's take a look at it.

04:19.540 --> 04:22.050
Yeah kind of like that.

04:22.050 --> 04:25.910
Now we also need to do that for the edges around here as well.

04:26.190 --> 04:34.020
Let's go back to that face select and let me see if I can get some of that down on the corners there

04:34.080 --> 04:35.120
on the edges.

04:35.310 --> 04:40.680
So I'll go back to stencil and see if we can do here.

04:41.200 --> 04:46.630
Let me take that brush down just a hair and paint right in there.

04:47.820 --> 04:55.200
And we go let me grab this down here like that.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.470
And over here on this edge

05:00.590 --> 05:04.390
OK so we've got that front panel down.

05:04.540 --> 05:05.850
That's not too bad.

05:06.910 --> 05:07.910
Once again.

05:07.910 --> 05:08.570
Yeah.

05:08.830 --> 05:09.290
All right.

05:09.290 --> 05:13.770
So let's now work on one of the side panels here.

05:14.800 --> 05:21.940
Zoom in to about the same size as we were before because we want the texture to be pretty much the same

05:22.030 --> 05:29.280
scale all the way around and hit the A key to de-select that area of the L key to select this panel.

05:30.420 --> 05:32.630
And let's see what we can do here.

05:32.680 --> 05:42.400
I'm going to increase the breast size and I'll just lay this down here.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.540
OK.

05:43.930 --> 05:45.700
Let's spin around to this side

05:48.400 --> 05:53.580
a key press the L key and let's lay it down here.

05:55.330 --> 06:01.290
And lastly let's get this signed selected with the L key.

06:01.410 --> 06:07.580
Increase the brush size of BET let's lay this down.

06:07.630 --> 06:08.020
All right.

06:08.020 --> 06:12.070
Let me turn back to view plain de-select everything.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.870
Turn off face masking.

06:13.870 --> 06:16.570
Zoom out a bit and see what we got here.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.030
Yeah that's not too bad.

06:18.070 --> 06:22.320
It kind of gives the sense that there's a texture to it.

06:23.100 --> 06:30.930
I think also I need to work a little bit on emphasizing the light and shadow of the folds here.

06:30.930 --> 06:37.890
Kind of like this but that's a good base texture I think to work with.

06:37.890 --> 06:38.190
All right.

06:38.190 --> 06:45.420
So I think to paint the light and shadow we don't really need this stencil here anymore.

06:45.420 --> 06:48.560
I'll hit the x key to remove that.

06:48.810 --> 06:53.480
I'd like to come down here and it looks like spacing and jitter is good.

06:53.490 --> 06:54.800
Those are pretty low.

06:54.820 --> 06:55.780
That's good.

06:56.930 --> 07:04.790
For painting the folds I think I'm going to need to turn on the pressure sensitivity for the radius

07:04.790 --> 07:12.950
of the brush so that I can draw a thin line on top and have it get thicker as it goes to the bottom

07:12.950 --> 07:17.420
to kind of replicate a fold in the cloth.

07:17.660 --> 07:24.110
So I'll turn the pressure sensitivity on here and let's sample another color here I'll press ass and

07:24.110 --> 07:26.610
sample a little bit darker color here.

07:29.460 --> 07:36.160
And I think I'm going to be drawing this down on this part right here.

07:38.470 --> 07:38.800
All right.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.580
Let's try this

07:44.370 --> 07:44.760
yeah.

07:44.770 --> 07:45.900
Something like that now.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.300
I don't know if you can see it but I'm just barely getting it.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.170
And that's what I want.

07:49.170 --> 07:51.550
I don't want anything real strong here.

07:54.950 --> 07:59.860
So this is very light and very subtle.

07:59.900 --> 08:04.760
I hope that's what I'm trying to do and I'm trying to be small up top.

08:04.760 --> 08:10.640
And then as I come down I'm pushing more to get the brush a little bit wider.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.850
Now one thing I notice look down here.

08:14.330 --> 08:16.000
That's bad.

08:16.100 --> 08:21.290
I'm pushing the brush stroke on down into the legs.

08:21.290 --> 08:22.610
Let me do this.

08:24.120 --> 08:32.940
Glad I caught that early so I'm going to go ahead and turn on face masking again and just select this

08:32.940 --> 08:37.540
panel so I don't accidentally paint on other parts of the models.

08:38.780 --> 08:39.010
Right.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.280
So I'll try it again.

08:44.440 --> 08:50.710
Well hopefully you can begin to see that shadow there happening in the folds.

08:50.740 --> 08:52.900
It's very subtle.

08:52.930 --> 08:55.380
I'm just trying not to do too much.

08:55.390 --> 08:58.570
It's easy to do too much on something like this.

08:58.600 --> 09:06.310
So now that I've got those in there I want to go back to a lighter color maybe something like this and

09:06.310 --> 09:13.080
start doing the same thing on the top of the fold here to get that highlight.

09:13.090 --> 09:14.750
So let's try that

09:18.980 --> 09:19.430
yeah.

09:19.440 --> 09:28.500
So you can see I think hopefully that will help the shadows pop out a little bit as well.

09:36.690 --> 09:38.090
All right so there we go.

09:38.160 --> 09:45.780
We've got a nice cloth texture that we've put down with the stencil brush and we've also done a little

09:45.780 --> 09:50.790
bit of hand painting to kind of make those folds pop.

09:50.790 --> 09:56.920
Now in addition to the normal map and the ambient occlusion map that will add in the game engine.

09:56.940 --> 10:02.990
I think this will really help give some realism and some interest to the cloth here.

10:03.180 --> 10:08.730
So I'll begin working on the rest of the tunic here.

10:08.730 --> 10:15.790
Just going through and doing the same kind of thing now I feel I would be remiss if I didn't mention

10:15.790 --> 10:19.540
yet again that we need to save this image.

10:19.540 --> 10:26.590
If I exited out of Blender now even if I saved my scene if I came in here and press control or command

10:26.650 --> 10:32.980
s and save the scene and then I exited all this would go away.

10:33.070 --> 10:38.950
So I just want to emphasize once again to be sure and save your images.

10:38.950 --> 10:46.570
So for me I'll come back over to the slots tab and click on Save all images and that makes the Asterix

10:46.570 --> 10:47.810
go away.

10:47.830 --> 10:53.050
It only takes a couple of times of losing your payment information for you to begin to remember to do

10:53.050 --> 10:54.520
that.
