WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:06.100
Well we're getting now to the more difficult parts of our U-V mapping.

00:06.130 --> 00:14.470
I'm going to switch over to the texture view and this is what we've done so far we've done the shoulder

00:14.480 --> 00:17.420
the tunic the glove and the leg.

00:18.130 --> 00:27.370
I'm probably going to be mirroring these over the glove the leg here so I'm not doing the other side

00:27.370 --> 00:32.190
right now but what I'd like to do now is these straps.

00:32.210 --> 00:35.040
Let's see what it's going to take to get these done.

00:35.140 --> 00:42.160
So I'm going to go ahead and select him and I'll go back to solid view here and let's figure out what

00:42.160 --> 00:47.460
kind of seams we need to mark for this.

00:47.710 --> 00:54.550
I'm going to try and press Allt and select this edge right here and that looks like it goes all the

00:54.550 --> 00:56.530
way down to here.

00:56.620 --> 01:03.830
Continue with it and shift and clicking here and that looks like it goes all the way around there so

01:03.830 --> 01:06.240
let's go ahead and mark a seam there.

01:08.310 --> 01:16.890
And I'll try the same thing down here Allt and select And let's see how far that goes right about to

01:16.930 --> 01:28.720
here and I'll press alt and shift and see what I can add to it like that and then down here like this.

01:28.870 --> 01:30.460
All right I've got that.

01:30.580 --> 01:33.920
Press Control E and Mark seam.

01:33.960 --> 01:38.040
Now let's come over here and let's work on the seam here.

01:38.210 --> 01:41.170
I'll press alt and click.

01:41.170 --> 01:42.760
That doesn't take me very far.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.890
How about let's continue on down here.

01:47.450 --> 01:55.130
I'm just pressing alt and shift and then I'll press control E and Mark seem all right we've got those

01:55.130 --> 01:59.590
seams marked looks good Let's come around here and do that to the back.

02:00.550 --> 02:10.060
I'll select this one and this one looks like that connected up so I'll press control E and Mark seam.

02:10.270 --> 02:11.660
And how about over here.

02:11.680 --> 02:21.990
Let's try this what I want to do is select this whole area with the L key and then we go and for Selecta

02:22.010 --> 02:28.630
linked I'll come back up here for material so that selects that entire torso.

02:29.330 --> 02:33.350
And now press shift h to hide all of that.

02:33.470 --> 02:38.130
So I can work on this a little better and see if we're getting all the edges.

02:38.270 --> 02:39.560
So this helps.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.400
Yeah I'll go ahead and re Mark this seam here now.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.970
And I'll do the same over here.

02:52.270 --> 02:55.350
You know Rigaud Let's try it.

02:55.350 --> 03:00.550
What I want to do is I'm going to hover over the strap and press the L key again but this time I'm going

03:00.550 --> 03:06.100
to switch back to choosing it or limiting it by the seam.

03:06.190 --> 03:09.880
And there we have just the strap.

03:09.880 --> 03:10.370
All right.

03:10.390 --> 03:13.650
Let's go over to our U-V editing view here.

03:14.970 --> 03:21.440
And with this selected press you and unwrap

03:24.880 --> 03:28.200
what do you think of that that's not too bad actually.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.970
I'm a little surprised at how well that turned out.

03:33.690 --> 03:35.540
It looks pretty good.

03:35.580 --> 03:35.930
All right.

03:35.940 --> 03:38.690
Let's go ahead and work with that.

03:38.700 --> 03:46.380
So now what we can do is begin selecting these areas down here that have been marked out by the seams.

03:46.380 --> 03:48.000
We just did.

03:48.180 --> 03:53.250
Let's take this now and press you and unwrap and see how that works.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.520
That's not bad.

03:55.540 --> 03:57.960
All right.

03:59.350 --> 04:00.440
The next one.

04:00.580 --> 04:02.700
Let's take a look at this right here.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.080
I think we're going to have to do something with this.

04:06.160 --> 04:12.760
We can't leave the arm or the glove here connected so I better split this off.

04:12.850 --> 04:19.630
I'm going to select this edge with all click and then I'll press control E and this time I'll choose

04:20.050 --> 04:29.910
edge split just to separate that from the rest of the torso and then I'll select this piece here.

04:30.830 --> 04:32.610
And let's just try and unwrap this.

04:32.610 --> 04:39.330
Actually I think what I'm going to need to do is create a seam right in here right underneath the arm

04:40.290 --> 04:41.650
actually right here.

04:41.730 --> 04:45.120
I'll choose alt and click that scene right there.

04:45.120 --> 04:50.490
And I don't need it to come all the way over so I'll de-select these.

04:50.550 --> 04:57.070
We've already got the belts done so I don't need that now press control.

04:57.090 --> 04:59.640
Me and Mark seem.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.710
And we go.

05:02.160 --> 05:09.940
Now if I hover over this and press l I'll press you and unwrap.

05:10.190 --> 05:12.610
That's not too bad either.

05:12.650 --> 05:13.910
All right.

05:13.910 --> 05:22.020
Now the next part this is the more complex part that we're going to have to actually think about.

05:22.020 --> 05:29.930
I'm going to come back to the default view here and let's think a little bit about this.

05:30.190 --> 05:36.010
Well we know we're going to need a seam down here just like we had for this arm.

05:36.040 --> 05:41.000
We know we're going to need a seam down here like this.

05:41.300 --> 05:45.090
Maybe let's make it more like this.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.560
There we go like that.

05:47.570 --> 05:52.760
All right so we know we've got that underneath the arm Let's go ahead and mark that scene.

05:53.210 --> 05:59.450
We probably are going to need to split this head off like this as much as I don't want to since this

05:59.450 --> 06:04.640
is all a continuous space or would be a continuous texture.

06:04.640 --> 06:13.540
I hate to break that up for fear of having a visible seam but I'm not seeing at least right now another

06:13.540 --> 06:15.080
way of doing that.

06:15.220 --> 06:17.730
Actually before I do that let's just test this.

06:17.740 --> 06:24.010
I'm going to go back to my U-V editing view and I'm going to hover over this and press.

06:24.030 --> 06:25.840
Well let's just test it.

06:25.840 --> 06:26.370
I'm depressed.

06:26.380 --> 06:37.030
You and unwrap not great not great look at the way the head just collapses in there.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.610
So that's going to have to be broken out.

06:39.640 --> 06:39.970
All right.

06:39.970 --> 06:45.640
So it doesn't look like I'm going to get away with just that seem on this.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.200
So let's go ahead and try this.

06:47.200 --> 06:55.300
I'm going to select this team now and I'll go ahead and select it all the way around to here and here.

06:55.300 --> 07:03.260
All right so Mark seeing him do that and then probably back here.

07:04.060 --> 07:13.030
I'm going to select this and then control click on up to here like that.

07:13.030 --> 07:15.520
Bring that seam up here.

07:16.170 --> 07:17.400
Maybe not that high.

07:17.400 --> 07:26.700
And usually for a head like this you want kind of a T shape may be coming off like this and maybe they

07:26.700 --> 07:28.350
could connect up with the ears.

07:28.350 --> 07:35.460
Let's just test that control e Mark seem all right so with those seams select let's just hover over

07:35.460 --> 07:41.960
the head and select that and let's just test these particular seams on a press you and unwrap.

07:42.510 --> 07:48.750
And that's a little better so we can begin to see the face on here.

07:48.750 --> 07:54.660
I'm going to go ahead and select all of this with the eight key and press R and rotated a bit just to

07:54.660 --> 08:01.440
try and line up those texture pattern just so I can see it and take a look at this and see if there's

08:01.680 --> 08:04.870
a whole lot of stretching is not bad on the face.

08:04.980 --> 08:10.350
And we've got the ears that are pretty stretched so it looks like we're going to have to select the

08:10.350 --> 08:13.020
seams for the ears around here.

08:13.780 --> 08:16.550
Like this.

08:16.760 --> 08:24.740
I'll go ahead and mark seem so I'll hover over the ear and press the L key and the head and press the

08:24.920 --> 08:27.600
key and let's try these again.

08:27.620 --> 08:31.540
I'll unwrap this and see how the ear breaks out.

08:32.440 --> 08:39.470
That breaks out kind of oddly we're going to need a seam there as well maybe a seam would be best down

08:39.530 --> 08:42.880
underneath the ear where we wouldn't see it very well.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.610
You always want to hide those seams whenever you can.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.440
So let's try this

08:51.730 --> 08:57.050
and we go and try that again you and unwrap.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.860
That's better.

08:58.860 --> 09:00.570
That's looking pretty good for the ear.

09:00.570 --> 09:04.220
I'll go ahead and do that same thing for the ear over here.

09:07.950 --> 09:09.880
All right with that ear mark.

09:09.930 --> 09:13.070
Let's go ahead and unwrap this see how it works.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.990
That is not looking too bad.

09:17.700 --> 09:22.290
There is a bit of stretching here around the face.

09:22.290 --> 09:28.580
These are a little bit bigger than the rest of the head.

09:28.620 --> 09:33.000
One way that we might be able to alleviate that is a seam down here.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.730
I'm not sure I want to do it but I'm going to try it and see

09:38.460 --> 09:42.510
what's Markis seem right here and try this

09:46.460 --> 09:48.660
a little bit better.

09:48.720 --> 09:55.950
I'm not sure I like the fact that these textures are a little bit smaller than the rest of the torso

09:56.970 --> 10:03.130
but I can always arrange them and scale them in the U-V Ed. We're getting there.

10:03.450 --> 10:08.490
I'm not totally happy with it yet but what we can do is we can test this.

10:08.490 --> 10:14.490
What I'm going to do is select everything just with the A key and I'm going to come over here and with

10:14.490 --> 10:18.920
the A key select everything to make sure all the U-V islands are selected.

10:19.470 --> 10:26.370
And then if you come down here to Uvas you can see you've got this average Island scale and pack islands.

10:26.370 --> 10:32.340
So average Island scale will make all of these proportionally the size that they are and the 3-D view

10:32.940 --> 10:38.530
and then pack islands will pack it all into the UV-A edited here all into this square.

10:38.550 --> 10:42.110
So what I'll do is I'll press control a.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.220
And that makes everything about the same size.

10:45.220 --> 10:49.470
And then I'll press control P and pack it in.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.840
Now it didn't pack it in very efficiently and that's ok.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.520
I just wanted to test this.

10:54.700 --> 11:02.440
I think in the next video what we should do is work with the U-V editing tools over in the U-V editor

11:03.190 --> 11:08.440
to try and read proportioned the face to match the rest of the body.

11:08.470 --> 11:10.510
So stay tuned for that in the next video.
