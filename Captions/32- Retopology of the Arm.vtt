00:00.670 --> 00:05.970
Well let's keep moving on and work some more on our read typology here.

00:06.010 --> 00:10.950
I think what I'd like to do is work on the shoulder areas.

00:11.320 --> 00:17.170
I think I'll just begin on this side this side is going to be interesting because of all the detail

00:17.170 --> 00:23.500
with the accessories and everything but I think I'm to work on this side here and all I want to do is

00:23.710 --> 00:31.990
draw or continue drawing down around the shoulders and the pecs here.

00:31.990 --> 00:39.820
And then also be mindful of what edges are going to be extended on down over the shoulder the shoulder

00:39.820 --> 00:46.170
is a really interesting part of the character because it can move in so many different directions.

00:46.180 --> 00:53.900
And it's always difficult at least for me to get the geometry correct or at least good enough.

00:53.950 --> 01:01.560
So the mash doesn't just collapse as it moves around as it as it forms.

01:01.630 --> 01:03.160
So I'll try again here.

01:03.170 --> 01:06.100
Every every time is a new experience I think.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.070
But let's give it a try.

01:08.080 --> 01:15.490
So with this head part selected I think I'm going to go back to the grease pencil and I'll just click

01:15.550 --> 01:21.230
draw and let's start working on drawing out the edges.

01:22.030 --> 01:28.780
For the pecs and the shoulder here I think I'm going to begin coming down the center of the character

01:28.780 --> 01:30.020
right here.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.550
So I'll begin here.

01:33.090 --> 01:34.850
Come straight down.

01:35.700 --> 01:41.130
And then these are going to kind of flare out a bit and then come back in.

01:43.590 --> 01:44.550
So

01:46.990 --> 01:56.140
these should begin moving towards the pecs So let me do this and let me extend this far there like this.

01:56.170 --> 01:59.660
And I said tecs I meant the shoulders here.

01:59.970 --> 02:05.210
So I'm going to begin taking this one this way like that.

02:06.680 --> 02:16.100
And then these will need to come straight out like this and this center one maybe began to go all the

02:16.100 --> 02:20.330
way down to the end of that deltoid I believe it is.

02:20.780 --> 02:29.460
I think I'll begin here for the cross-sections and come out around the neck there.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.370
And then this one I'll continue like this.

02:35.650 --> 02:40.130
I'll go ahead and bring this one up and on around like this.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.000
I'll do the same here like this

02:50.030 --> 02:57.330
and for this one I'll bring it more around like this and maybe one more.

02:57.630 --> 02:59.190
Let's try this right here.

02:59.190 --> 03:03.380
Not sure if that one will work so I'll press enter.

03:03.450 --> 03:07.440
Come back to the tools and click add surface.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.220
And there we go.

03:10.270 --> 03:16.210
Now once again we've got some that are flipped and some that aren't all press a to select everything

03:16.210 --> 03:24.040
and then I'll press control in to recalculate normal's and then we should have that all pointing in

03:24.040 --> 03:25.480
the right direction.

03:25.480 --> 03:29.650
Now one thing I see here is I've got this one that connect it up on me.

03:29.650 --> 03:31.250
I didn't mean to do that.

03:31.270 --> 03:37.520
So with this selected maybe I could hit the that's the Ripp tools soldiers hit V.

03:37.540 --> 03:38.810
And let's see what happens.

03:38.830 --> 03:40.030
There we go.

03:40.030 --> 03:41.680
That pulls it out like that.

03:41.860 --> 03:42.330
OK.

03:42.340 --> 03:53.190
So now what I can do is select these points and I will then bridge them I'll select these as well

03:56.410 --> 04:05.580
and if I press control I have the edges menu and I can select bridge edge loops and there we go.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.790
So now that connects that up.

04:07.790 --> 04:14.060
All right let's go round the back here and do the same thing for the back of the character.

04:14.150 --> 04:20.790
I think I want to draw out edge loops that match these and then bring these down as well.

04:20.810 --> 04:25.550
So let me turn off x ray for a moment here.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.920
And let's try and draw this out as well.

04:30.410 --> 04:41.970
So I'll go back to the grease pencil hit the draw button and I'll extend this around to here and extend

04:41.970 --> 04:42.930
this around

04:45.980 --> 04:49.520
I'll bring this around over the shoulder to the back

04:52.240 --> 04:54.090
and maybe this one as well.

04:57.370 --> 05:03.510
And then I think what I'll do is go ahead and dry out edges here.

05:04.820 --> 05:08.150
And here see how that works.

05:09.960 --> 05:17.060
And now let's extend the edges from the back of the neck sort of extend to this one.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.020
This one

05:21.340 --> 05:24.000
this one so I'm just trying to match up those edges.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.790
That.

05:35.020 --> 05:40.270
And then this one should come out over the shoulder like this.

05:40.270 --> 05:51.150
I'll hit enter and then go back to the Tools tab and click add surface and then we go hit x ray quite

05:51.150 --> 05:58.440
a few are flipped so I'll select everything and press control in to recalculate the normal's and there

05:58.440 --> 05:59.360
we go.

05:59.760 --> 06:09.010
So now what I can do is select these edges or select this vertex and then control select this one and

06:09.010 --> 06:18.160
then select these and then control the bridge edge loops.

06:18.780 --> 06:28.910
So I'll do the same thing here I'll select these points and these points and control me and bridge edge

06:28.910 --> 06:36.590
loops and then I'll just select these four and then hit the F key and there we go.

06:36.590 --> 06:41.900
So now we're beginning to get that edge flow over the shoulder here.

06:43.310 --> 06:47.680
I'll select these and I'll go ahead and turnon snapping right down here.

06:49.150 --> 06:57.330
And hit E and extrude these up to here and I'll merge these with Allt M and at last.

06:58.210 --> 07:08.870
And also over here I'll select these edges and extrude and bring these over a bit and then merge these

07:08.870 --> 07:10.790
together with all to him.

07:11.510 --> 07:18.770
Now to continue with the shoulder I think what I'll try is selecting these points here and I'm going

07:18.770 --> 07:27.410
to extrude these and pull them down toward the edge of the of the deltoids here so I'll hit B and extrude

07:27.410 --> 07:30.660
these down to maybe right about there.

07:31.520 --> 07:37.110
And I'll go ahead and select these two and merge these with all to him at the center.

07:37.130 --> 07:39.370
Let's see how that works.

07:39.500 --> 07:43.360
Maybe I'll pull that in to snap that a bit.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.990
You know we go and I'll do the same thing here.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.980
See if I can get those to snap in there.

07:52.310 --> 07:56.390
All right I'm going to take this edge here.

07:57.500 --> 08:02.540
And what I'm going to do is extrude it on down around here and connect it up there.

08:02.540 --> 08:03.650
I'm going to do one

08:07.750 --> 08:08.410
two

08:11.500 --> 08:12.860
and then he snap these.

08:12.850 --> 08:13.240
Now

08:22.610 --> 08:29.340
so then maybe I'll do one more extrusion before I connect it up let me pull this back down.

08:29.410 --> 08:38.080
I'll select these two hit E for extrude one more extrusion and then I'll begin arranging these to connect

08:38.080 --> 08:39.660
these up.

08:39.690 --> 08:45.090
So now if I select these four vertices and hit the F key I can connect that up.

08:45.100 --> 08:49.450
So now we've got how many edges do we have here.

08:49.450 --> 08:55.860
Let's see how pressed the old key and select and it looks like we've got 10.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.230
That's not bad.

08:57.250 --> 09:05.500
So now I know if I do use the shrinkwrapped tool to create the arm I know I need a cylinder of 10 the

09:05.500 --> 09:08.190
sides of 10 edges.

09:08.290 --> 09:13.950
So to create the arm I'll come over to the Create tab and click on cylinder.

09:13.960 --> 09:25.600
And so instead of 32 vertices I'll use 10 and I'll choose a cat filled type of nothing and I'll go ahead

09:25.630 --> 09:28.200
and increase the depth a bit.

09:28.360 --> 09:36.910
Increase the radius just a little analysis try and put that in place over the arm.

09:37.090 --> 09:46.820
Let's also add a few edge loops so oppressed control are in scroll the mouse wheel until we get a few

09:46.820 --> 09:49.400
edge loops here something like this.

09:49.400 --> 09:53.090
I think I've got five here so far.

09:53.180 --> 09:55.970
Let's try that.

09:55.970 --> 10:02.230
And with this selected I'll go to the modifiers panel and add the shrinkwrap modifier.

10:02.660 --> 10:05.420
And for the target I'll choose character.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.190
Let's see how that works.

10:07.190 --> 10:14.410
So it caught the torso here let's see if I can just move that a bit and yeah it'll pop off of that and

10:14.420 --> 10:18.340
there is our arm geometry.

10:18.380 --> 10:19.910
Let's see how it worked.

10:19.910 --> 10:24.140
I'm going to hit apply and turn on x ray.

10:24.300 --> 10:30.710
I'll go ahead and combine these two objects I'll select this and shift selected this and I'll press

10:30.710 --> 10:33.700
control J to join them.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.060
So now they're all one object.

10:36.230 --> 10:42.650
And now I think I'd like to extrusions to get to here to connect these up.

10:42.650 --> 10:44.280
So what I can try.

10:44.600 --> 10:52.150
If I press alt and click here and then alt shift and click here what I could try.

10:52.550 --> 10:54.120
I'm not saying it's going to work.

10:54.140 --> 11:02.750
But what I could try is press control E and I will bridge edge loops here but then I'll come over here

11:03.140 --> 11:07.250
and increase the number of cuts too like that.

11:07.490 --> 11:10.990
So that gives me extra geometry around there.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.120
Now there's some tweaking we need to do of course but that gets me pretty close.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.150
That's not too bad.

11:19.340 --> 11:20.100
All right.

11:20.300 --> 11:26.570
So there we have the beginnings of the typology of the arm and the shoulder.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.680
I'm going to need to work on the glove here.

11:29.720 --> 11:36.560
I think that will be a whole other object that all shrink wrap around that glove cuff thing and then

11:36.560 --> 11:40.610
I'll connect them together the way I did the boot and the leg.
