00:00.750 --> 00:02.810
Well today I'd like to work on the ear.

00:02.830 --> 00:10.860
It's I think the shape is pretty good but I'd like to get a little more detail around the edges of the

00:10.860 --> 00:12.710
ear and on the insides.

00:12.930 --> 00:20.610
So I've gone out and found a couple of images on Google Images one of a bat ear and one of obviously

00:20.820 --> 00:25.620
a human ear for reference just to have up to look at.

00:25.620 --> 00:32.520
While I do this I'm going to switch to sculpt mode here and I'm going to hover over the ear and press

00:32.610 --> 00:36.650
alt f just to center the ear up in my view.

00:36.690 --> 00:44.220
And now when I tumble around it's going to tumble around that part of the model and also going to press

00:44.220 --> 00:49.140
the End key to bring up the properties panel and turn on the mat cap again.

00:49.140 --> 00:55.500
I kind of like this particular shading when I'm sculpting so I'll then hit the End key to close that

00:55.500 --> 01:04.580
up and I just want to cut in here a little bit more and to define the edges a little bit better.

01:05.010 --> 01:14.130
So I'm going to hit the F key to reduce the brush size and I'll press shift F to reduce the strength

01:14.130 --> 01:14.760
a bit.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.090
And let's give this a try.

01:17.090 --> 01:23.330
So I'm going to press the control key and I'm just going to sculpt and push in just a bit to kind of

01:23.330 --> 01:28.100
make that indentation a little bit more defined.

01:28.370 --> 01:31.280
And appear a bit something like this.

01:31.430 --> 01:39.530
And then I'm also going to come in here and cut in just a bit in here like there's an indentation in

01:39.530 --> 01:41.940
there.

01:42.250 --> 01:49.000
Now I'd like to have a little kind of a notch coming out here kind of like this piece on our ear or

01:49.000 --> 01:52.510
maybe this piece on the bat ear.

01:52.690 --> 02:01.190
So I don't increase the strength just a bit here and let me try it right in here.

02:06.730 --> 02:14.160
You know just to get that out there like that or maybe use the grab brush to take that and move it back

02:14.160 --> 02:14.810
a bit.

02:17.230 --> 02:17.640
It's

02:24.070 --> 02:27.970
something like that and maybe drag it out just a bit more like that.

02:28.360 --> 02:34.650
So it just takes a little bit of time a little bit of patience to build something like this up.

02:34.900 --> 02:42.910
And the reference images are absolutely essential for something like this even though it's a fantasy

02:42.910 --> 02:48.160
character you still need to be able to ground it in reality and that's what the reference images can

02:48.160 --> 02:49.500
do for you.

02:49.760 --> 02:55.560
And I'm going to try and bring a ridge like this down into the ear see if that'll work.

02:55.570 --> 03:00.850
I'm not sure if that will work with this particular kind of character but why not give it a try.

03:09.650 --> 03:11.060
And I like what's going on here.

03:11.060 --> 03:18.170
But I think it needs to be a little bit thicker so I'll work on bringing this out a little bit more.

03:19.870 --> 03:27.250
And then maybe smoothing that back I think maybe I'll try and get a little bit more of an ear lobe right

03:27.250 --> 03:29.620
here like this.

03:29.620 --> 03:36.470
Maybe I'll take that grab tool and see if I can just pull this down just a little bit.

03:38.630 --> 03:40.880
Kind of hint at an ear lobe here.

03:43.190 --> 03:46.230
Maybe pull this part down just a hair as well.

03:49.290 --> 03:58.080
And I've got a problem with the math here and I'm not going to work too hard at fixing that because

03:58.140 --> 04:03.780
ultimately this will be baked into a normal map.

04:03.810 --> 04:11.490
All this sculped detail will be baked into a normal map which will be applied to the low poly model.

04:11.910 --> 04:19.940
So for a glitch or a problem like this I can always just paint that out in the normal map.

04:19.980 --> 04:25.140
So I'm not going to get too upset about this and try and smooth that out.

04:25.200 --> 04:31.590
That sometimes happens and since we're going to be using a normal map anyway I can just fix it then.

04:33.210 --> 04:36.200
All right so let me do just a couple more things here.

04:36.210 --> 04:41.590
But I think this is generally the kind of look I want here.

04:41.610 --> 04:47.020
I'd like to get these bulging out just a little bit better here.

04:47.250 --> 04:56.120
This area like so and then smooth it back a bit.

04:56.640 --> 05:00.490
So it kind of is in line with the side of the head there.

05:02.450 --> 05:08.840
And then what I'd like to do too is come in and tighten up some of these edges.

05:08.840 --> 05:12.720
So I've got the basic shape down.

05:13.010 --> 05:17.570
I think what I'll do is come in and tighten some of the edges around here.

05:17.570 --> 05:28.330
So if I come over to the pinched tool I can let's see what happens if I come in here and just sculped

05:28.380 --> 05:36.490
along this edge here see if I can tighten that up just a bit and maybe down here as well.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.100
Something like that.

05:38.100 --> 05:47.910
Now I come over here to the crease tool and I can maybe increase the amount of definition in this crease

05:47.910 --> 05:50.450
here and maybe also here

05:55.370 --> 05:56.680
see how that looks.

05:57.700 --> 05:58.120
Yeah.

05:58.130 --> 05:59.200
So something like that.

05:59.210 --> 06:07.510
So it just helps it define that area a little bit better maybe even come in here with the crease tool

06:07.510 --> 06:08.150
like that

06:12.620 --> 06:13.150
yeah.

06:14.090 --> 06:14.540
All right.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.740
So I think we're getting there I think there's more that I can do.

06:17.750 --> 06:22.300
I'm not real pleased with this area right in here maybe I'll work more on that.

06:22.340 --> 06:30.020
But generally speaking you get the idea you can go in and begin sculpting and getting more detail in

06:30.020 --> 06:31.680
the ears like that.

06:32.180 --> 06:37.320
Well believe it or not we're getting close to the end in fact I think what I'm going to do.

06:37.460 --> 06:41.420
Let me go back here and bring everything back.

06:41.480 --> 06:47.730
So I think what I'm going to do from here is do some cleanup work try and finalize it.

06:47.750 --> 06:53.990
But then I think in the next videos what I'd like to do is begin on a tweet apologizing the character

06:55.020 --> 07:01.920
you can see here that up at the top that we were over six and a half million tries.

07:01.920 --> 07:06.330
That's just far too much for a game engine for any game engine.

07:06.390 --> 07:13.080
So we'll need to read to apologize this to create a low polygon version of it that we can then take

07:13.080 --> 07:14.580
into unity.

07:14.580 --> 07:18.910
So we'll see how many tries we can get it down to as we read apologize.

07:19.260 --> 07:22.070
So stay tuned for that coming up soon.

07:22.080 --> 07:27.230
A series of videos on Reid apologizing to create a low poly mesh.
