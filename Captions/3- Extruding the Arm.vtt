00:00.540 --> 00:03.960
Let's keep moving forward with our character here.

00:04.170 --> 00:08.810
I think the next thing we should do is maybe work on the arms.

00:09.050 --> 00:14.640
All we really need to do here is select a couple of faces and extrude these out.

00:14.640 --> 00:22.140
Now if I extruded this out the way it is now and hit the e key and extruded out we only get it on one

00:22.140 --> 00:27.900
side so we kind of went the other side to come along for the ride as we model.

00:28.060 --> 00:35.910
So I'm going to undo out of this with control over command Z and what I'd like to do is just delete

00:35.910 --> 00:42.600
one half and then set up the mirror modifier So the model will stay symmetrical as we model.

00:42.690 --> 00:49.500
So to do that I'm just going to maximize this screen here the front for you by pressing control up arrow

00:49.830 --> 00:52.400
and that'll maximize that view.

00:52.670 --> 00:59.070
I'll hit the Z key for wireframe and I'll hit the big key for border select and I'll just click and

00:59.070 --> 01:08.730
drag and let's get these selected here then press X to delete and choose faces.

01:08.860 --> 01:09.910
And there we go.

01:09.910 --> 01:13.600
So now we've got half of the character deleted.

01:13.600 --> 01:18.340
I'm going to press control up arrow again to come back to my two window view.

01:18.820 --> 01:20.640
I'm going to tab out of edit mode.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.800
Hit the Z to go into solid shading.

01:24.010 --> 01:28.600
And now I'm going to come over here to the Properties window and I'm going to choose this little wrench

01:28.600 --> 01:37.120
here and this is the modifiers panel I'll click add modifier and the LIT's choose mirror.

01:37.340 --> 01:38.550
And there we go.

01:38.550 --> 01:47.050
Now I usually also choose clipping here that will ensure that any points along the center line of the

01:47.050 --> 01:52.210
model will get snapped to each other and merge together.

01:52.210 --> 01:55.830
All right so I'll hit the tab key to go back into edit mode.

01:56.230 --> 02:04.240
I can turn this little guy on this adjust edit cage and see the faces on the other side as well.

02:04.240 --> 02:04.510
All right.

02:04.510 --> 02:06.430
So let's go ahead and work on the arms.

02:06.430 --> 02:13.510
I'm going to select these two faces and hit the e key and I'm going to immediately click and then just

02:13.510 --> 02:18.020
press g for move and just move these out.

02:18.430 --> 02:28.410
I'm going to use the scale tool to flatten these up the press the s key and scale that down a bit.

02:28.440 --> 02:34.320
Now I'll come in here and kind of work on these I'll select these two points and just scale them in

02:34.330 --> 02:35.850
a bit.

02:35.930 --> 02:43.550
No I won't because I've still got individual origins selected I'm going to change this to median point

02:43.550 --> 02:46.240
again and then I should be able to scale these.

02:46.590 --> 02:55.040
And again I'll just move these out to kind of shape the arm a bit

02:57.830 --> 03:04.440
Go to face mode and hit each for extrude and I'll just come straight out.

03:05.860 --> 03:07.380
Something like this.

03:07.540 --> 03:13.300
I think I will have these more relaxed and down.

03:16.490 --> 03:19.150
Let me move these down as well.

03:19.550 --> 03:22.940
Rotate them a bit.

03:23.220 --> 03:27.270
So I'm just trying to shape the arms a bit.

03:27.270 --> 03:31.300
So they're in more of a relaxed pose.

03:31.450 --> 03:38.080
I'm just using both the front and the side view to see how I'm doing here.

03:39.770 --> 03:45.030
Now I think we need to insert some edge loops up here around the shoulder so let's go ahead and do that

03:46.630 --> 03:50.520
while press control r and insert and then loop up here.

03:54.380 --> 03:56.850
And I'll scale them to kind of fit their

04:00.680 --> 04:02.250
Let's take a look at the head here.

04:02.270 --> 04:06.350
I'm going to select these points and just begin moving them out a bit.

04:06.650 --> 04:09.350
So they're not quite so blocky

04:12.720 --> 04:22.320
something like this.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.050
In addition I think I'd like to work on this piece right down here.

04:26.050 --> 04:32.950
Now there's an edge loop that's going to flow down around the front here around the crotch and also

04:32.950 --> 04:34.950
back here along the back.

04:35.290 --> 04:40.720
And I'd like to go ahead and get those set up before I move any farther.

04:40.810 --> 04:46.920
So the way to do that is I'm going to insert an edge loop right along here and that will of course inserted

04:46.920 --> 04:49.290
in its loop on the other side as well.

04:49.810 --> 04:54.550
And I want to insert an edge loop across here and bring it down.

04:57.110 --> 04:58.790
Something like that.

05:01.160 --> 05:06.970
And the whole purpose of this is to get this edge to flow down around like this.

05:07.010 --> 05:13.730
What I want to do first is actually cut an edge from here to here and then delete these two.

05:13.730 --> 05:22.820
So I just going to hit the cakey for the knife tool and click here and then click here and hit enter

05:22.940 --> 05:24.200
or return.

05:24.530 --> 05:32.340
Then I'm going to take this edge and dissolve it and then I'm going to take this edge and dissolve it

05:32.490 --> 05:36.700
by pressing the x key and then going to dissolve edges.

05:37.170 --> 05:43.790
And now you can see I've got this flow coming around here and that edge flow will help us as we sculpt

05:43.800 --> 05:47.240
the transition between the hips and the legs.

05:47.250 --> 05:47.730
All right.

05:47.730 --> 05:51.300
Well now that I've got that let's spin around on the back side and get that.

05:51.300 --> 05:57.890
Now this is the front view and I pressed the one key to get here I can also press control one key and

05:57.890 --> 06:00.260
I'll spin around to get the other side.

06:00.510 --> 06:07.460
So now I can press the KCI and knife this side but I'm not getting a little highlighted points here

06:07.470 --> 06:09.260
that tells me I can cut.

06:09.270 --> 06:14.070
The problem is this is the mirrored side if I come over here there.

06:14.100 --> 06:17.220
That looks a little better so I'll cut here.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.110
And then here.

06:19.290 --> 06:21.090
And hit enter.

06:21.090 --> 06:30.090
And now I go back to edge mode and dissolve this edge with the x key and press X here as well and dissolve

06:30.120 --> 06:31.110
edges.

06:31.110 --> 06:34.260
So there we've got that edge flow going around.

06:34.350 --> 06:40.770
Now I need to dissolve these edges along the side and these edges down beneath.

06:40.770 --> 06:47.830
So I'll just press on it and click this edge and then choose X and dissolve.

06:48.300 --> 06:56.100
Now we go and now down here on the bottom I'll go back to the default view and let's tumble down here

06:56.600 --> 07:04.080
and I need to get rid of these as well so I'll press alt and click those X and dissolve edges.

07:04.080 --> 07:12.080
Now we go now I have to give credit to Scott Spencer for this particular method of doing things.

07:12.090 --> 07:18.180
He is a digital sculptor extraordinaire and his book digital sculpting is great.

07:18.180 --> 07:25.020
So you got to take a look at that if you are interested in really going into detail into sculpting human

07:25.020 --> 07:25.780
forms.

07:26.780 --> 07:31.810
All right so with that let me spin around here again and hit the one key.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.170
Know we go.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.320
We're getting there now.

07:34.340 --> 07:39.920
This line of edges is really tight and close together here.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.980
In addition we need an extra edge loop down the center of the legs.

07:44.030 --> 07:49.610
So what I'm to do is I'll go ahead and press control are in insert and loop here because we're going

07:49.610 --> 07:50.730
to need that.

07:50.900 --> 07:58.820
But also I need to come through and begin moving these out a bit so I'm going to take this and just

07:59.120 --> 08:05.590
begin pulling these out to kind of spaced these out a little better.

08:09.660 --> 08:14.200
For these up here I'll use the slide edge tool if you press control.

08:14.250 --> 08:23.450
You get a menu for edges if you press control f you get a menu for faces and if you press control V

08:23.470 --> 08:25.780
you get a menu for vertices.

08:26.020 --> 08:34.510
So for edges or press control E and go to Ed slide down here and now I can just drag the mouse and it'll

08:34.510 --> 08:40.480
slide that edge along that existing plane will do the same thing over here.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.910
All right we're coming along.

08:45.960 --> 08:51.090
We've still got work to do on the arms and of course the hands and we're going to begin inserting some

08:51.090 --> 08:57.750
edge loops and doing things like pulling these points around the side of the character to get them a

08:57.750 --> 09:02.190
little bit more rounded out like that.

09:02.790 --> 09:05.100
But ultimately it's looking pretty good.

09:05.100 --> 09:12.060
I do need to be sure and keep the base mesh a little smaller than the reference drawing.

09:12.060 --> 09:20.160
To give myself a little room to sculpt because when I sculpt I'm going to want to add forms and pull

09:20.160 --> 09:26.010
things out to create the shape of the body rather than cutting in.

09:26.010 --> 09:34.230
So this base mesh really needs to be smaller or skinnier than the actual character so that we can add

09:34.230 --> 09:37.120
forms instead of taking away.

09:37.200 --> 09:43.410
So in the next video we'll keep going and we'll try and finish off the base mesh so we can finally start

09:43.410 --> 09:44.040
sculpting.
