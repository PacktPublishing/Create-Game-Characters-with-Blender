00:00.630 --> 00:07.800
Well even though we've got all the standard poses down now we've got the contact pose here at frame

00:07.800 --> 00:12.970
1 and at frame 7 we've got the down pose here at frame 2.

00:13.080 --> 00:20.670
We've got the passing pose frame four and we've got the up at frame 5 and we've got the reverse of all

00:20.670 --> 00:25.050
of these over here from 7 to 13.

00:25.050 --> 00:32.730
But if you notice there's these empty frames There's three and six here and even though I don't have

00:32.730 --> 00:36.580
a particular name for these I feel like I need to clean them up a bit.

00:36.600 --> 00:42.490
They're kind of wonky now and and they don't really look good as poses.

00:42.660 --> 00:45.120
So let's try and work on these a bit.

00:45.120 --> 00:51.650
So we've got our contact pose here are down when the foot hits flat here on the ground.

00:51.840 --> 00:58.800
What I need unframed three is that foot to continue to be flat on the ground and actually be underneath

00:58.800 --> 01:06.030
the character kind of supporting the weight or the centerline of the character and I need this back

01:06.030 --> 01:08.230
foot kind of passing by that.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.240
So let's try that.

01:09.240 --> 01:16.110
I want to take that foot control here of the left foot and hit Allt are in clear the rotation on that

01:16.480 --> 01:24.840
I'll also press all g to clear the location and on this foot roll I'll press alt r as well so now we've

01:24.840 --> 01:31.590
got that foot right back in the center where it began flat on the ground and that's what I think we

01:31.590 --> 01:35.040
want for that for this one here.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.280
I mean make sure the rotations zeroed out.

01:38.370 --> 01:39.660
Yikes.

01:39.720 --> 01:44.650
And let me clear the rotation on this one real quick and now rotate that back.

01:47.030 --> 01:54.890
Let me go to my rotate tool so I can rotate it in this axis exactly like this.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.530
All right let's see how that works.

01:56.530 --> 02:01.260
I'm going to come back to my contact.

02:01.420 --> 02:08.980
There's the down there's that in-between on frame three and then passing it frame for that looks pretty

02:08.980 --> 02:09.990
good.

02:10.880 --> 02:23.480
I like that we've got our position at frame 5 and at frame 6 this is should be kind of the only frame

02:23.480 --> 02:27.930
in the cycle where both feet are off the ground and they are and that's good.

02:28.070 --> 02:30.900
But the pose itself isn't real great.

02:30.920 --> 02:35.600
I'll go ahead and make sure this is cleared with all that are.

02:35.660 --> 02:44.030
And then I'll rotate it back up just a bit like so and maybe even bring that out a little bit so it's

02:44.030 --> 02:52.770
a little more extreme and this I'll go ahead and clear the rotation just so I know it's clear.

02:52.790 --> 02:54.640
And then I'll rotate this back.

02:55.780 --> 02:58.230
And maybe bringing him up like that.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.290
So it's a little more of an interesting pose.

03:04.650 --> 03:08.130
Angle that backs some like that.

03:08.130 --> 03:08.450
All right.

03:08.460 --> 03:11.780
So we've got let's see how we did here.

03:12.000 --> 03:23.250
Contac down that in-between pose at frame three the passing the up and that in-between when his feet

03:23.250 --> 03:26.600
are off the ground and then back to the contact.

03:27.030 --> 03:29.950
OK so let's select everything now.

03:29.970 --> 03:40.070
I'm going to go and save just in case here and I'll go back over to frame three and I'll copy that with

03:40.070 --> 03:41.420
this button here.

03:42.780 --> 03:51.660
And then I'll move it to the mirror image frame which is going to be frame 9 and paste that.

03:51.700 --> 03:52.560
All right.

03:53.340 --> 03:58.170
Then I want to go back to frame 6 right here.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.870
I'll copy that.

04:02.030 --> 04:08.880
And I want to go up to frame 12 right and paste that here.

04:10.310 --> 04:11.140
There we go.

04:12.720 --> 04:18.000
OK a save and let's scroll through and see what we got.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.070
How does it look.

04:19.070 --> 04:21.830
Did I destroy anything in what I just did here.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.690
That sometimes happens.

04:23.720 --> 04:32.450
So here's frame one frame to frame three four five five looks a little high.

04:32.450 --> 04:35.190
He looks like he's kicking his leg up a little high.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.740
But let's let's go with it for now here.

04:38.530 --> 04:39.650
Six.

04:39.700 --> 04:47.560
That's when he's off the ground and back to the contact there's the down that passing or that extra

04:47.600 --> 04:56.540
in-between there's the passing the up that extra when he's off the ground and back down.

04:56.540 --> 04:59.760
All right let's play this and see how it looks.

05:01.510 --> 05:01.720
All right.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.260
Not bad.

05:02.260 --> 05:08.080
Now one thing you'll notice is that it's got a little bit of extra a glitch or something at the very

05:08.080 --> 05:13.920
end of the cycle and that's because we have duplicated frame one to frame 13.

05:13.930 --> 05:17.920
And I did that just so we would have a constant loop.

05:17.920 --> 05:24.410
But ultimately when we actually use the run cycle we'll just use frames 1 through 12.

05:24.430 --> 05:30.630
So I've changed the end to 12 here and now there shouldn't be quite as much of a pop.

05:30.650 --> 05:34.760
So there we go we've got him running we've got a pretty good run cycle.

05:34.770 --> 05:41.690
There's more I could do here I feel like he could come down a little bit more on the down positions.

05:42.630 --> 05:44.760
At frame two and eight.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.380
In fact why don't I just do that.

05:46.380 --> 05:58.220
I'll take this and move them straight down just a tad and then I'll take that frame to let me de-select

05:58.280 --> 05:59.740
everything over here.

06:00.290 --> 06:08.210
I'll find that torso as it is so I'll select that one keyframe there and we need to duplicate that to

06:08.210 --> 06:10.230
frame 8.

06:10.320 --> 06:14.040
So here's frame eight here.

06:14.390 --> 06:18.240
Shift DE and I'll move it to frame eight.

06:18.260 --> 06:20.840
They're And we go.

06:21.110 --> 06:23.280
So now let's see how that works.

06:25.600 --> 06:25.800
Yeah.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.880
He goes down just a little bit more.

06:31.590 --> 06:32.040
Good.

06:32.130 --> 06:32.860
OK.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.910
So now that we have the basic run cycle for the legs from the side view let's switch over to the front

06:39.910 --> 06:45.760
view I'll hit the one key and let's just take a look at where everything is positioned from the front

06:45.760 --> 06:46.000
view.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.790
Now here's the initial contact pose and it looks to me like the knees a little pointed inward a little

06:54.790 --> 06:56.020
too much.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.860
Let me go forward some.

06:58.000 --> 07:06.330
So yeah it looks like the knees especially here are pointed or are pushed in too far.

07:06.560 --> 07:13.070
So I think I just need to go through and adjust the controls a bit to try and get them the way we want

07:13.070 --> 07:14.370
them here.

07:14.420 --> 07:20.480
So maybe this can come out a bit to be more in line with the foot.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.520
Let's move forwards here.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.800
I feel like this knee could come out a bit right here.

07:31.120 --> 07:37.690
So we just need to go through and make sure it looks like the legs are in a position to support the

07:38.050 --> 07:39.490
weight of the character.

07:39.490 --> 07:44.760
Now at this pose right here I feel like that Annie could come out just a little more like that.

07:46.540 --> 07:54.800
Now I am creating a lot of key frames here and I may need to go through and delete some of these Let's

07:54.800 --> 07:55.970
see how it looks.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.910
That's not bad.

08:02.300 --> 08:08.750
We've still got a lot of work to do on the arms of course I'm going to pause for just a minute and I'm

08:08.750 --> 08:16.200
going to go through and just hide some of these layers here so I can see what's going on.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.150
We'll turn them on here in a minute again.

08:18.210 --> 08:21.180
But I just want to see it without all the controls.

08:23.580 --> 08:29.780
So we've got some jittery stuff happening on the arms and the hands and that's fine.

08:30.060 --> 08:37.500
There may be more tweaking we can do once we get the arms set up and they're not glitching out like

08:37.500 --> 08:38.760
that so much.

08:39.580 --> 08:42.090
But generally speaking I think we're doing all right.

08:42.160 --> 08:46.630
I think you know we're going to see him in game mainly from back here

08:50.060 --> 08:50.410
yeah.

08:50.450 --> 08:52.310
I think that's going to work.

08:52.310 --> 09:00.020
So when me pause him here and what we'll do in the next video is we'll start working on swinging those

09:00.020 --> 09:03.560
arms back and forth with the hammer and the shield.
