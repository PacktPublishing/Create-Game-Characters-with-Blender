00:00.770 --> 00:04.800
I'd kind of like to work on these seams for the gloves.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.290
I don't know why but I've been thinking about this.

00:07.290 --> 00:11.760
I just I'm not sure if this is going to work and I'm interested in trying it.

00:11.790 --> 00:14.520
So let's go ahead and do this.

00:14.610 --> 00:21.570
I'm going to go over to the mask tool and hit the F key and reduce the radius.

00:21.780 --> 00:26.250
The strength is that one or 100 percent so I'm going to keep it there.

00:26.430 --> 00:34.270
And what I want to do is kind of draw the seam all the way around right down here around the back.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.010
I'm not really sure if it's going to work.

00:38.090 --> 00:41.150
That's kind of why I've been thinking about it and want to try it.

00:41.150 --> 00:42.470
So let's try this.

00:42.470 --> 00:48.450
I'm going to begin here in just draw this area here.

00:48.810 --> 00:56.630
And I think I'm going to come down here to the thumb Let's try that.

00:56.690 --> 01:07.550
I just want to come right down here to the thumb like that and I want to get this right along here like

01:07.550 --> 01:08.570
this.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.920
As I said I am not sure that this is going to work at all.

01:13.790 --> 01:16.070
This is not doing real well.

01:16.130 --> 01:26.620
My hands are not staying real smooth here so let's try and stroke this smooth stroke here.

01:26.630 --> 01:29.600
This maybe would be a little bit better to use.

01:30.020 --> 01:38.210
And what that will do is it will kind of leave the brush behind and it'll follow along with this line.

01:38.210 --> 01:43.360
Here you see how it's giving me a little bit of time before it draws

01:46.460 --> 01:49.510
and we go a little bit better.

01:51.720 --> 01:58.710
And you can of course adjust the line and how long that line is.

01:58.890 --> 02:01.300
But this looks pretty good.

02:01.470 --> 02:11.140
All right now I'm going to go ahead and test this before I draw it over the entire glove because what

02:11.140 --> 02:15.140
I'll also want to do is come over here and come down here as well.

02:15.400 --> 02:20.900
So I'm going to test this just to see if I'm even on the right track or if it's just dumb.

02:21.580 --> 02:25.040
So what I'm going to do is press control.

02:25.990 --> 02:35.410
And then I'll come back up here to my sculped draw and I'll increase the strength just a little bit

02:35.410 --> 02:39.110
with the F key or the size I should say.

02:40.420 --> 02:44.120
I'm going to keep the strength pretty low and let's give this a try.

02:44.120 --> 02:54.980
So I'm just going to fairly go on this and try this kind of pull this out just a little bit and then

02:54.980 --> 02:56.660
I also want to flatten it a bit.

02:56.660 --> 02:57.570
Let me try this.

02:57.570 --> 03:01.280
I'll hit the Flaten try and flatten it.

03:01.490 --> 03:04.170
So it isn't bulging out

03:06.980 --> 03:13.370
something like that now and it hit him to clear.

03:13.370 --> 03:17.690
And I was kind of hoping for a little more there.

03:17.780 --> 03:26.010
Let me undo this and try and go a little bit harder on it.

03:26.050 --> 03:27.590
See what happens.

03:28.970 --> 03:34.190
If I give it a little bit more is that going to be too much.

03:34.190 --> 03:37.270
There old M.

03:42.040 --> 03:46.530
Actually that is getting close to what I was after.

03:48.150 --> 03:50.630
Yeah that's interesting.

03:51.710 --> 03:57.170
All right then let me go with Chris tool here come in here.

03:58.520 --> 04:06.200
And just try and tighten up that seem just a little bit in the middle there.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.510
That's actually kind of what I was thinking.

04:11.730 --> 04:15.290
Well that's weird.

04:15.300 --> 04:22.950
All right let's keep going then and try and take that on around to the other side over here.

04:22.950 --> 04:30.050
All right so I'm going to go back to the mask tool and give this a try.

04:30.060 --> 04:33.590
Keep on keep on going.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.480
Take that down to about like that.

04:38.160 --> 04:42.170
And I think I will turn on that smooth stroke here.

04:42.180 --> 04:47.260
Try this.

04:47.310 --> 04:54.820
Let's try and bring this on down to the pinky.

04:54.860 --> 04:58.990
I'll try another one from here to bring it down right next to it.

05:01.630 --> 05:04.110
Now let's try and draw the seam underneath

05:11.270 --> 05:12.230
and there we go.

05:12.230 --> 05:12.670
All right.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.770
I'm just going to try and clean up some of this here.

05:20.830 --> 05:23.660
Add to this a bit.

05:24.190 --> 05:30.140
Now another question is is do I want these to go around the fingers as well.

05:30.220 --> 05:32.300
I think maybe I do.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.500
So I'll try that.

05:34.510 --> 05:39.430
I'll turn on the smooth stroke again and I'll try and get this right around the fingers here.

05:43.140 --> 05:46.910
In addition I think I'll do a seam right down here.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.700
Try this.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.420
Don't know if I need it.

05:51.510 --> 05:59.280
Go ahead and do one here and then I want to connect those around the thumb as well so I'll turn my smooth

05:59.280 --> 06:06.510
stroke back on and start around the thumb.

06:06.890 --> 06:07.300
All right.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.540
Well let's give this a try.

06:08.540 --> 06:14.210
I'm going to go ahead and press control I need to inverse the selection and then I'll come back to my

06:14.210 --> 06:18.200
sculped draw brush increased the size a bit.

06:18.200 --> 06:24.800
I'll leave the strength where it is since I think that's what was working the last time and I'll give

06:24.800 --> 06:29.210
it a try.

06:29.210 --> 06:29.680
All right.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.520
So are we ready to try this.

06:31.550 --> 06:36.870
Let's give it a try Allt him in clear and let's see what we did.

06:38.740 --> 06:39.430
Yeah.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.120
You know what I think I can work with this.

06:43.150 --> 06:50.150
There are some places here that I might want to either smooth out or build up.

06:50.300 --> 06:58.070
But generally speaking this area here is kind of like that and that area there I kind of I kind of like

06:58.070 --> 07:06.860
I'm going to come back to that crease tool and come in here try and tighten that crease up just a little

07:06.860 --> 07:08.510
bit right in here.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.870
I like that.

07:13.180 --> 07:14.860
And do I want to do that in here.

07:14.870 --> 07:17.780
No I think these are pretty tight enough.

07:17.950 --> 07:21.310
In fact I think I can probably smooth those back a little bit.

07:21.310 --> 07:28.450
I'm going to press the smooth and the shift key and smooth that back just a little bit.

07:28.450 --> 07:31.330
I don't need it quite that much.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.020
Bring it back a little bit.

07:34.360 --> 07:40.130
Riego But yeah I think that works pretty well.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.870
I don't like this area right in here.

07:41.870 --> 07:46.670
I'll have to work on that but I'm actually ok with this.

07:46.670 --> 07:56.960
I think with the textures the different colors seem from the main color of the of the gauntlet here

07:57.320 --> 07:58.710
I think.

07:59.030 --> 08:01.010
I think that'll look pretty good.
