00:00.570 --> 00:02.920
Today I'd like to work on the hands.

00:03.030 --> 00:11.010
We could go into edit mode and pull points around like we did with the hips but I think what I'd like

00:11.010 --> 00:19.020
to do instead for these is come down in the subdivision level over here just click and the sculped value

00:19.020 --> 00:24.300
and bring that down maybe to one so we can kind of see the polygons and what I'd like to do is just

00:24.300 --> 00:31.450
pull some points around pull some polygons around to reshape this thumb a bit.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.100
So zoom in here.

00:33.300 --> 00:40.470
I think what I'll also do is hover over the hand right here and press alt F and that will allow me now

00:40.470 --> 00:44.990
to tumble around the hand.

00:45.030 --> 00:55.470
All right so now if I zoom in here and increase the brush just a bit and start with the grab brush start

00:56.250 --> 01:04.410
pulling these back and kind of rearranging these to get more of a shape on the thumb that I want here.

01:04.730 --> 01:13.060
So I'm just going to move these around here and we go a little bit better.

01:15.810 --> 01:18.620
I'll come around to this side and work on over here.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.270
All right.

01:34.690 --> 01:39.040
So I've got the thumb kind of the way I want it to of course.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.950
There's more to do here.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.760
Let's work on the fingers here.

01:46.760 --> 01:52.830
I think maybe I'll take all of this and move it up just a bit in here.

01:57.860 --> 02:04.750
All right so let's come back up in the subdivision levels here or come back up to three and with three

02:04.760 --> 02:12.310
I'm just going to start roughing in a little bit more of the padding of the hand a little bit more of

02:12.310 --> 02:15.020
the meat of the hand.

02:15.020 --> 02:24.380
So if I come back over here to the clay strips brush and maybe add just a little bit right up here kind

02:24.380 --> 02:29.040
of curving that area where the knuckles are.

02:29.360 --> 02:41.870
And then back here maybe begin to rough in the pads of the hands maybe something like this here and

02:41.870 --> 02:49.070
this other one over here at the thumb and the great thing about hands is you've got built in reference

02:49.070 --> 02:54.930
images right on your other hand so I can just hold my hand up and take a look.

02:56.190 --> 03:06.010
And I'm also going to put some pads right along here at the base of the fingers.

03:06.480 --> 03:14.130
And at this point I'll maybe hint at the tendons along the top of the hand here so maybe I'll reduce

03:14.130 --> 03:16.220
the brush size a bit.

03:16.260 --> 03:25.370
Let me just test here and see what the strength is like and maybe I could suggest the tendons here at

03:25.370 --> 03:32.780
the back of the hand and I should probably begin using the inflate brush and try and inflate the fingers

03:32.780 --> 03:34.070
and thumb out a bit.

03:34.070 --> 03:37.650
So there are more cylindrical and not so pointed.

03:37.700 --> 03:43.130
I'll come over here to the inflate brush right here and let's work on that

03:55.170 --> 04:01.450
and I'll use the smooth brush to try and smooth down that point at the tip of the finger.

04:01.470 --> 04:09.650
It doesn't need to be quite that pointed you can use the inflate again.

04:14.970 --> 04:22.590
And also at the top of the fingers we could use the flattened brush a bit just to kind of flatten the

04:22.590 --> 04:24.270
tops here.

04:25.110 --> 04:36.090
Now it might make our lives a little easier if I masked off certain fingers and we could certainly do

04:36.090 --> 04:36.360
that.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.350
I do want to mention one caveat with that.

04:40.350 --> 04:47.280
One problem that you can run into so right now all the work I'm doing is being mirrored over to the

04:47.280 --> 04:54.810
other side here because I've got symmetry on right here along the x axis.

04:54.810 --> 05:03.090
However if I were to say wanted to hide the body and work on the hand if I press the H key here and

05:03.150 --> 05:07.230
dragged and selected all of this to hide it.

05:07.410 --> 05:13.980
Now if I came in when a press alt to zoom in on that and zoom in here.

05:14.100 --> 05:22.230
Now let's say I came in and did something like I'll just do something kind of drastic here to make a

05:22.230 --> 05:26.530
point say I did this.

05:26.550 --> 05:35.040
Now if I come back and press alt H and come back over here to the other side you can see that it didn't

05:35.040 --> 05:36.120
come through.

05:36.570 --> 05:44.100
So be careful of the trap of thinking that you can hide off the other side of the body and it will mirror

05:44.100 --> 05:44.810
over.

05:45.030 --> 05:47.390
In this particular sculpt mode.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.180
And with these particular tools it won't do that.

05:50.340 --> 05:57.510
When we get to the point when we were using the Duyne Toppo sculpting tools and that's a newer type

05:57.510 --> 06:03.730
of sculpting in Blender there is a tool here called symmetry.

06:03.990 --> 06:10.980
Not sure how you pronounce that where you can force the sculpting information from one side of the body

06:11.010 --> 06:12.490
over to the other.

06:12.840 --> 06:20.910
But when you use this method of sculpting you can't use the levels of subdivisions like we're doing

06:20.910 --> 06:21.720
here.

06:21.720 --> 06:29.200
So I usually save the Duyn Toppo for more detailed fine work.

06:29.220 --> 06:34.160
Maybe for clothing or skin wrinkles or something like that.

06:34.290 --> 06:35.910
It's good for that.

06:35.910 --> 06:40.230
So just a warning about symmetry and hiding.

06:40.260 --> 06:47.430
Be careful that you don't do a whole lot of work on one side and realize then when you unhide everything

06:47.820 --> 06:50.030
that it isn't over here as well.

06:50.100 --> 06:58.590
So if you want to hide the body while you're sculpting the hand one good way to do it is just to press

06:58.680 --> 07:06.780
age and maybe hide the center part of the body while retaining the parts that are going to be mirrored

07:06.780 --> 07:08.430
over.

07:08.490 --> 07:08.930
All right.

07:08.930 --> 07:22.540
So I will go back to the in-flight brush here and work a little bit more on this finger.

07:22.820 --> 07:28.810
And once again I'll use the smooth brush at the top here to try and smooth that tip down a bit.

07:30.970 --> 07:32.820
And then inflate it back out.

07:36.190 --> 07:43.210
And then once again I'll hit the back of the finger here with the flattened brush just kind of flatten

07:43.210 --> 07:50.080
the top up a bit and let's work on the pinky here as well.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.560
It needs some volume to it.

07:58.960 --> 08:05.840
And the smooth brush up top here and take the point off a little bit.

08:18.600 --> 08:24.450
And periodically I'll just smooth it back and try and redo the shape when it gets a little out of hand

08:26.100 --> 08:28.160
and the flat brush as well here.

08:29.220 --> 08:30.050
And the back

08:35.120 --> 08:35.890
I'm going to come back.

08:35.890 --> 08:40.340
The clay strips brush and just add a little form on the outside here.

08:41.620 --> 08:43.340
And we try and even add up some

08:46.360 --> 08:48.670
and we still need to work on that thumb.

08:48.670 --> 08:49.380
Now don't we.

08:49.390 --> 08:52.390
So let's work on that of debt inflate that up

08:56.400 --> 09:03.510
and I'll come back to the clay strips and then begin trying to shape the hand a little bit more.

09:03.570 --> 09:12.390
I believe I am going to go ahead and add another subdivision level to this to try and get a little more

09:12.390 --> 09:14.010
detail in here.

09:14.070 --> 09:21.240
We don't need a whole lot at this point in time but it be nice to have a little bit more detail on the

09:21.240 --> 09:22.610
hand right now.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.730
I'm going to pull the wrist in just a hair here and over on this side as well.

09:34.310 --> 09:39.970
So I will go ahead and come over here to the subdivide button and just press it one more time.

09:40.130 --> 09:43.700
And that gives us one more subdivision level over here.

09:44.660 --> 09:51.960
It makes things a little smoother but it also gives us a little bit more freedom to add some detail.

09:51.980 --> 09:57.920
So at this point in time I think I'll add just a little more meat to the pads of the hands here.

09:57.920 --> 10:06.470
Continuing with the clay strips and then I'll use this sculpt draw brush right here bring the strength

10:06.480 --> 10:12.720
then some and use this to kind of give us a wrist bone here something like this

10:16.570 --> 10:21.160
and just for reference.

10:21.170 --> 10:28.660
And so we kind of know where things are as we're going to move it up just a bit.

10:30.790 --> 10:38.020
Like this maybe and I'll smooth it back don't need it quite that heavy something like that.

10:39.150 --> 10:44.130
That'll just help position things as we go.

10:44.130 --> 10:48.290
Maybe some pads here along the base of the fingers.

10:50.370 --> 10:58.400
And I think I'll come back here with a sculpt draw tool and just draw those tendons in one more time.

10:58.400 --> 11:04.850
All right well that's a pretty good start to our hands in the next video we'll work on detailing them

11:04.850 --> 11:10.130
a little bit more giving more definition to the pads and the knuckles.

11:10.130 --> 11:11.960
But for now I think that's pretty good.

11:13.090 --> 11:18.600
Let's go ahead and bring back the rest of the character here with old age.

11:18.670 --> 11:19.420
And there we go.

11:19.420 --> 11:25.270
And we want to make sure that the information did get mirrored over to the other side and it looks like

11:25.270 --> 11:25.870
it did.

11:25.900 --> 11:26.930
That's good.

11:27.310 --> 11:34.580
So our task coming up is to kind of finish up the hands and even the lower legs here.

11:34.750 --> 11:38.790
And of course we need to rough them the basic forms of the head and face.

11:38.830 --> 11:41.240
We haven't even touched that yet.

11:41.260 --> 11:43.160
So all of that is coming up soon.
